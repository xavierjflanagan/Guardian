description: Deploy Guardian application with healthcare-specific considerations
---

Sergei, help me deploy the Guardian application. Please consider:

1. **Healthcare Data Safety**: Ensure zero-downtime deployment to maintain access to critical health information
2. **Environment Configuration**: Verify all healthcare-related environment variables are properly set
3. **Database Migrations**: Run any pending migrations with HIPAA compliance considerations
4. **Infrastructure Scaling**: Check if infrastructure can handle current healthcare data processing loads
5. **Security Validation**: Verify all security measures are in place for PHI protection
6. **Monitoring Setup**: Ensure healthcare data processing monitoring is active

Please provide step-by-step deployment guidance with healthcare compliance in mind.
