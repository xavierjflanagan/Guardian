description: Optimize AI processing pipeline for cost and performance
---

Tessa, help me optimize the AI processing pipeline. Please:

1. **Cost Analysis**: Analyze current processing costs and identify optimization opportunities
2. **Performance Review**: Evaluate processing speed and accuracy metrics
3. **Model Comparison**: Compare different AI providers for specific document types
4. **Confidence Optimization**: Optimize confidence scoring while maintaining healthcare standards
5. **Batch Processing**: Implement batch processing optimizations where appropriate
6. **Quality Maintenance**: Ensure optimizations don't compromise healthcare data quality

Optimization focus: $ARGUMENTS
