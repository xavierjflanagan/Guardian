1. **Healthcare Design Patterns**: Use established healthcare UI patterns and accessibility standards
2. **Medical Data Visualization**: Ensure appropriate display of medical information
3. **Multi-Profile Support**: Design with family healthcare profile switching in mind
4. **Accessibility Compliance**: Implement WCAG 2.1 AA standards for healthcare accessibility
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure mobile accessibility for healthcare on-the-go
6. **Quality Indicators**: Include confidence and quality indicators where appropriate
