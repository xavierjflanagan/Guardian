Execute the sign-in protocol to start a new work session with proper documentation and context gathering.

$ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps to complete the sign-in protocol, create a todo list and execute systematically:

## üéØ **Protocol Steps**

### Step 0: Git Hygiene Check
- Run `git status` and `git fetch origin` before any other protocol actions.
- Summarize:
  - Any uncommitted changes? (Prompt to commit/stash)
  - Is `main` behind `origin/main`? (Prompt to pull/review)
  - Any new remote changes? (Prompt to review PRs or pull)
- If all clear, confirm you're ready to proceed.
- *Why?* This keeps your repo safe, up to date, and prevents conflicts‚Äîprofessional daily Git workflow.

### Step 0.5: Review Protocol Documentation
- Read `docs/protocols/README.md` to understand the full context and intended outcomes of the protocol system
- This ensures proper execution and validates that all promised benefits are delivered

### Step 1: Check Previous Session
- Review the last entry in `docs/PROGRESS_LOG.md` to ensure the previous session was properly signed off.
- If the last session is missing completion details:
  - Ask: *"I notice your last session wasn't properly signed off. Do you remember what you accomplished and how long you worked? I can help you complete that sign-off first."*
  - If the user provides information:
    - Execute the sign-off protocol retrospectively using the provided details, then proceed with sign-in.
  - If the user doesn't remember or doesn't respond:
    - Add a default entry to the progress log:
      ```markdown
      ## [ESTIMATED_DATE] Previous Session (Incomplete Sign-off)
      - **Duration:** Unknown
      - **Accomplishments:** Session occurred but details not recorded
      - **Status:** Incomplete documentation - sign-off missed
      - **R&D Hours:** 0 (cannot verify for compliance)
      ---
      ```
    - Then proceed with current sign-in.

### Step 2: Gather Session Information
Ask the user these questions in a single message (dot points, one after the other):

For this session;
- What are your main goals? (2-3 key objectives or tasks)
- How long do you plan to work?
- Any specific areas you want to focus on? (Optional: e.g., frontend, backend, documentation, architecture)

**If the user provides a diary-style or detailed written response for session goals or context, copy and paste their full response verbatim into the progress log entry for full context preservation.**

### Step 2.25: Review AI Context
**Comprehensive AI Context Review** in `docs/context/AI_context.md`:

- Read through the entire AI context file to understand current project state
- Note the latest session updates, decisions, and next steps
- Identify any blockers or priorities from previous sessions
- Understand recent architectural or technical decisions
- Gather context about project evolution and current focus areas

This review will inform both the task sync and session briefing steps.

### Step 2.5: Sync Technical Tasks
- Read the current `docs/management/TASKS.md` file.
- Check for any updates or changes since last session.
- Sync all technical tasks with the Notion Technical Task Board (https://www.notion.so/22887f8cee9e816b98cbc8a99950d452).
- Ensure both TASKS.md and Notion board are up to date (push/pull as needed).
- **Use AI context insights** to better understand task priorities and status.

### Step 3: Update Progress Log
- **Get current date and time**: Use `date` command to get current date and time
- **Append** a new entry at the top of `docs/PROGRESS_LOG.md` in this format:
  ```markdown
  ## [YYYY-MM-DD] Work Session Started
  - **Start Time:** [HH:MM TIMEZONE from date command]
  - **Session Goals:** [User's main objectives]
  - **User Summary:** [User's verbatim response]
  ---
  ```
  *Note: Both date and time come from the `date` command output*
- **Important:** Never edit or overwrite any session logs (including 'Work Session Started' blocks). Every session event must be append-only for audit and compliance.

### Step 4: Provide Contextual Briefing
Generate a comprehensive session briefing by combining insights from:

- **AI Context Review**: Current project state, recent decisions, priorities, and blockers
- **Progress Log**: Recent session summaries and accomplishments
- **Task Status**: Current task priorities and any updates from Notion sync
- **User Goals**: How the user's session goals align with project priorities

**Briefing should include:**
- Current project phase and focus areas
- Recent progress and key decisions
- How user's goals fit into overall project direction
- Any relevant blockers or considerations
- Contextual encouragement based on recent momentum

## üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling**

If previous session wasn't signed off:
1. **Offer to complete it** before starting new session
2. **Allow user to skip** if they prefer
3. **Note the gap** in documentation

If files are missing:
1. **Create them** with appropriate templates
2. **Note file creation** in response
3. **Continue with protocol**

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

Protocol is successful when:
- [x] Previous session status checked
- [x] User goals and plans captured
- [x] Session start documented
- [x] User receives helpful briefing

The goal is to **quickly orient** the user and **set up the session** for productivity.

## üìÅ **Files That May Need Updates**

### Primary Files (Always Update)
- `docs/PROGRESS_LOG.md` - Session start logging

### Review Files (For Context)
- `docs/context/AI_context.md` - Canonical project context and recent decisions
- `docs/management/TASKS.md` - Current task priorities and status
- Recent entries in progress log for session continuity

**Execute this protocol systematically and provide a comprehensive session briefing to get the user oriented and productive quickly.**
