# Tessa's AI Processing Insights

## Model Performance Patterns

### Current Processing Pipeline
- Google Cloud Vision OCR: 99.8% accuracy on medical documents
- GPT-4o Mini Vision: Excellent medical terminology extraction
- Combined approach provides 85-90% cost reduction from AWS Textract

### Optimization Strategies
- Medical documents with handwriting require OCR preprocessing before Vision AI
- Lab reports benefit from structured extraction templates
- Confidence thresholds above 85% maintain healthcare-grade accuracy

## Cost Optimization Learnings

### Provider Comparison
- Google Cloud Vision: $1.50/1K docs (OCR safety net)
- GPT-4o Mini: $15-30/1K docs (medical analysis)
- Combined: ~$16.50-31.50/1K docs vs $250/1K with Textract

### Processing Efficiency
- Batch processing reduces per-document costs
- Document preprocessing improves extraction quality
- Confidence-based routing optimizes cost vs accuracy trade-offs

## Medical Data Extraction Patterns
- Medication lists require drug interaction validation
- Lab results need temporal context for trending
- Diagnostic reports benefit from structured FHIR mapping
