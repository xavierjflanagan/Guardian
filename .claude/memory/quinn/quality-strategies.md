# Quinn's Quality Assurance Strategies

## Medical Data Validation Patterns

### Healthcare-Specific Quality Checks
- Medical terminology accuracy validation against standardized vocabularies
- Drug interaction cross-referencing with pharmaceutical databases
- Clinical date consistency checking across multiple documents
- Multi-profile data isolation validation to prevent contamination

### Confidence Score Management
- >85% confidence threshold maintains healthcare-grade accuracy
- Confidence scores below threshold trigger manual review workflows
- Quality flags provide actionable feedback for data improvements
- Automated confidence score trending identifies processing degradation

## Testing Frameworks

### Healthcare Data Testing
- Medical document processing requires specialized test datasets
- FHIR compliance testing needs standardized healthcare scenarios
- Multi-profile testing covers complex family healthcare use cases
- Performance testing must account for healthcare document variability

### Quality Automation
- Automated quality checks run on every processed document
- Quality flag resolution workflows reduce manual intervention
- Continuous monitoring identifies quality degradation early
- Quality metrics dashboards provide system health visibility

## Error Pattern Analysis

### Common Quality Issues
- OCR accuracy decreases with handwritten medical documents
- Medical terminology extraction requires context for disambiguation
- Date parsing needs healthcare-specific format recognition
- Drug names require pharmaceutical database validation
