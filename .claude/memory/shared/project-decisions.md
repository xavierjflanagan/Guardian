# Guardian Project Decisions and Cross-Agent Insights

## Major Architecture Decisions

### Guardian v7 Implementation
- **Decision**: Adopted unified clinical events architecture with multi-profile support
- **Rationale**: Enables comprehensive family healthcare management from day one
- **Impact**: All agents now consider multi-profile implications in their recommendations
- **Date**: July 2025

### AI Processing Pipeline Optimization
- **Decision**: Switched from AWS Textract to Google Cloud Vision + GPT-4o Mini pipeline
- **Rationale**: 85-90% cost reduction while maintaining >85% confidence threshold
- **Impact**: Tessa manages cost-optimized processing, Sergei handles infrastructure scaling
- **Date**: July 2025

## Cross-Agent Collaboration Patterns

### Infrastructure + AI Processing
- Sergei and Tessa collaborate on database optimization for document processing workloads
- Infrastructure scaling must account for AI processing demand patterns
- Cost optimization requires both infrastructure efficiency and AI model selection

### Quality + Healthcare Data
- Quinn and Cleo ensure medical data validation meets healthcare standards
- FHIR compliance testing requires both quality assurance and healthcare expertise
- Medical terminology validation bridges quality control and clinical accuracy

### Frontend + Analytics
- Prue and Ana collaborate on user engagement optimization
- Healthcare interface design benefits from user behavior analytics
- A/B testing requires both UI implementation and metrics analysis

## Shared Healthcare Context

### HIPAA Compliance Requirements
- All agents must consider PHI handling in their recommendations
- Audit logging requirements affect all system components
- Healthcare data security is a cross-cutting concern

### Multi-Profile Architecture
- Family healthcare coordination impacts all system design decisions
- Data isolation between profiles is a critical security requirement
- Healthcare consent management affects user interface and data access patterns
