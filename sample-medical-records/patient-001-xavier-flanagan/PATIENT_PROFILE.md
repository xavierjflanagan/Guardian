- Xarelto correctly identified as active
- Discontinued medications flagged

### Scenario 3: Timeline Construction
**Objective:** Test chronological ordering of medical events
**Steps:**
1. Extract dates from all documents
2. Order encounters chronologically
3. Display patient timeline

**Expected Outcome:**
