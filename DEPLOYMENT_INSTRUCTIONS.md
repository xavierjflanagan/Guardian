# Supabase V3 Foundation Deployment Instructions

## 🚨 BEFORE PROCEEDING

**Please tell me what tables appeared when you ran this dependency check:**
```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name IN (
    'user_profiles', 'patient_medications', 'patient_conditions',
    'clinical_narratives', 'patient_clinical_events'
);
```

**This determines which migrations need modification!**

## 📁 Migration Files Created

I've created the first migration file:
- ✅ `supabase_migrations/20240925000001_universal_date_format_management.sql`

**Still need to create (based on your table results):**
- ⏳ `20240925000002_temporal_data_management.sql`
- ⏳ `20240925000003_narrative_architecture.sql`
- ⏳ `20240925000004_medical_code_resolution.sql`

## 🚀 Deployment Methods

### Method A: Supabase CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Place migration files in your Supabase project
mkdir -p supabase/migrations
cp supabase_migrations/*.sql supabase/migrations/

# 2. Test locally first
supabase db reset --local
supabase start

# 3. Deploy to production
supabase db push
```

### Method B: Manual Sequential Deployment
1. Copy content from `20240925000001_universal_date_format_management.sql`
2. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
3. Execute and verify success
4. Repeat for remaining files **in order**

---

## ⚠️ Critical Notes

- **Run in sequence** - each migration depends on previous ones
- **Test on staging first** if you have a staging database
- **Create backup** before running production deployment
- **Check table dependencies** - some migrations may need modification based on your current schema

---

## 📊 Dependency Status Needed

**What I need from you:**
1. Results of the table dependency check
2. Do you have an existing Supabase project structure?
3. Do you prefer CLI deployment or manual SQL Editor deployment?

Based on your answers, I'll create the remaining migration files with proper modifications for your database state.
