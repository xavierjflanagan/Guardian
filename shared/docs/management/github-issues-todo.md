## üö® CRITICAL Priority Issues

### [Issue #28](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/28) - üõ°Ô∏è RLS Policy Testing Framework
**Urgency:** üö® **CRITICAL**  
**Healthcare Impact:** CRITICAL - 117 untested RLS policies represent highest data security risk  
**Estimated Time:** 3 weeks  
**Description:** Guardian has 117 Row Level Security policies across 14 migration files that are completely untested, creating serious vulnerabilities in patient data isolation and healthcare compliance.  
**Context Documentation:** [Phase 3.2 Security Implementation](../architecture/frontend/implementation/phase-3.2-implementation.md)  
**Dependencies:** None - can start immediately  
**Compliance Risk:** Australian Privacy Act + HIPAA violations possible

---

## üî• HIGH Priority Issues

### [Issue #29](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/29) - üîí Automated PII Detection
**Urgency:** üî• **HIGH**  
**Healthcare Impact:** HIGH - Required for Australian Privacy Act compliance  
**Estimated Time:** 3 weeks  
**Description:** Current PII sanitization only removes basic hardcoded fields but lacks pattern-based detection for Australian healthcare identifiers (Medicare, TFN, AHPRA) in medical document content.  
**Context Documentation:** [PII Detection Requirements](../security/compliance/australian-privacy-act.md)  
**Dependencies:** Document processing pipeline integration  
**Compliance Risk:** Privacy violations in medical record processing

### [Issue #30](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/30) - üìä Security Monitoring Infrastructure
**Urgency:** üî• **HIGH**  
**Healthcare Impact:** HIGH - Zero operational visibility into production healthcare system  
**Estimated Time:** 3 weeks  
**Description:** Guardian currently has NO error tracking, uptime monitoring, or security incident alerting infrastructure, leaving the healthcare platform blind to outages, breaches, and system failures.  
**Context Documentation:** [Monitoring Implementation Plan](../operations/monitoring-implementation.md)  
**Dependencies:** Sentry account setup, UptimeRobot configuration  
**Business Risk:** Service outages and security incidents go undetected

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM Priority Issues

### [Issue #27](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/27) - üß™ Test Framework Reliability
**Urgency:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM**  
**Healthcare Impact:** MEDIUM - Healthcare audit logging lacks proper test coverage  
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes  
**Description:** The useEventLogging test suite is failing due to incomplete Supabase authentication mocking, preventing proper test coverage for healthcare audit logging functionality.  
**Context Documentation:** [Phase 3 Advanced Features](../architecture/frontend/implementation/phase-3-advanced-features.md)  
**Dependencies:** None - simple jest.setup.js fix  
**Technical Debt:** Blocking CI/CD reliability

### [Issue #31](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/31) - ‚ö†Ô∏è TypeScript Safety
**Urgency:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM**  
**Healthcare Impact:** MEDIUM - Medical data processing lacks type safety  
**Estimated Time:** 2.5 weeks  
**Description:** Guardian has 13+ TypeScript `any` type warnings in critical healthcare components, removing type safety protections for medical data processing and patient information handling.  
**Context Documentation:** [Frontend Implementation](../architecture/frontend/implementation/)  
**Dependencies:** None - can be implemented independently  
**Code Quality:** Patient safety type validations needed

### [Issue #32](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/32) - ‚ö° Edge Runtime Compatibility
**Urgency:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM**  
**Healthcare Impact:** MEDIUM - Real-time features but has fallback  
**Estimated Time:** 2 weeks  
**Description:** Supabase Realtime client uses Node.js-specific APIs incompatible with Vercel Edge Runtime, potentially causing failures in serverless healthcare data subscriptions.  
**Context Documentation:** [Phase 3 Advanced Features](../architecture/frontend/implementation/phase-3-advanced-features.md)  
**Dependencies:** Vercel Edge Runtime deployment testing  
**Impact:** Real-time provider dashboards may need polling fallback

### [Issue #33](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/33) - üõ°Ô∏è CSP Middleware Header Conflict
**Urgency:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM**  
**Healthcare Impact:** LOW - Security configuration bug  
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour  
**Description:** Content Security Policy headers are incorrectly applied to API routes, causing header conflicts and potential security misconfigurations. Discovered by GPT-5 technical review.  
**Context Documentation:** [Phase 3.2 Security Implementation](../architecture/frontend/implementation/phase-3.2-implementation.md)  
**Dependencies:** None - simple middleware fix  
**Technical Fix:** Remove duplicate CSP header sources

### ‚úÖ [Issue #34](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/34) - üîß Node.js Version Conflict **[RESOLVED]**
**Status:** ‚úÖ **CLOSED** (August 18, 2025)  
**Root Cause:** Investigation revealed Node version was NOT causing CI failures  
**Actual Problems Fixed:**
- **PRIMARY**: TypeScript compilation errors in validation tests (discriminated union type guards)
- **SECONDARY**: Missing Supabase auth mocking (`supabase.auth.getSession()` crashes)
- **INFRASTRUCTURE**: Implemented production-quality testing patterns with centralized utilities
**Additional Improvements:** Type safety, dependency injection, resilient test assertions
**Node Version Status:** Real issue but LOW priority quality improvement (warnings only)
