## 🚨 CRITICAL Priority Issues

### [Issue #28](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/28) - 🛡️ RLS Policy Testing Framework
**Urgency:** 🚨 **CRITICAL**  
**Healthcare Impact:** CRITICAL - 117 untested RLS policies represent highest data security risk  
**Estimated Time:** 3 weeks  
**Description:** Guardian has 117 Row Level Security policies across 14 migration files that are completely untested, creating serious vulnerabilities in patient data isolation and healthcare compliance.  
**Context Documentation:** [Phase 3.2 Security Implementation](../architecture/frontend/implementation/phase-3.2-implementation.md)  
**Dependencies:** None - can start immediately  
**Compliance Risk:** Australian Privacy Act + HIPAA violations possible

---

## 🔥 HIGH Priority Issues

### [Issue #29](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/29) - 🔒 Automated PII Detection
**Urgency:** 🔥 **HIGH**  
**Healthcare Impact:** HIGH - Required for Australian Privacy Act compliance  
**Estimated Time:** 3 weeks (partial progress made)  
**Description:** Current PII sanitization only removes basic hardcoded fields but lacks pattern-based detection for Australian healthcare identifiers (Medicare, TFN, AHPRA) in medical document content.  
**Context Documentation:** [PII Detection Requirements](../security/compliance/australian-privacy-act.md)  
**Dependencies:** Document processing pipeline integration  
**Compliance Risk:** Privacy violations in medical record processing  
**✅ Partial Progress:** Fixed GitHub Actions PII detection false positive (commit 5e731bd)

### [Issue #30](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/30) - 📊 Security Monitoring Infrastructure
**Urgency:** 🔥 **HIGH**  
**Healthcare Impact:** HIGH - Zero operational visibility into production healthcare system  
**Estimated Time:** 3 weeks  
**Description:** Guardian currently has NO error tracking, uptime monitoring, or security incident alerting infrastructure, leaving the healthcare platform blind to outages, breaches, and system failures.  
**Context Documentation:** [Monitoring Implementation Plan](../operations/monitoring-implementation.md)  
**Dependencies:** Sentry account setup, UptimeRobot configuration  
**Business Risk:** Service outages and security incidents go undetected

## ⚠️ MEDIUM Priority Issues

### ✅ [Issue #27](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/27) - 🧪 Test Framework Reliability **[RESOLVED]**
**Status:** ✅ **CLOSED** (August 18, 2025)  
**Root Cause:** Critical events using server-side audit logging instead of client-side mocking  
**Actual Problems Fixed:**
- **PRIMARY**: Test cases expecting critical events (document_view, document_download) to use client mocks
- **SECONDARY**: Updated tests to use non-critical events (search, filter, view_profile) for client-side testing  
- **INFRASTRUCTURE**: All 9 useEventLogging tests now passing with proper healthcare compliance validation
**Additional Improvements:** Restored CI/CD pipeline reliability for healthcare audit logging functionality
**Business Impact:** Test framework reliability restored, healthcare audit logging properly tested

### [Issue #31](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/31) - ⚠️ TypeScript Safety
**Urgency:** ⚠️ **MEDIUM**  
**Healthcare Impact:** MEDIUM - Medical data processing lacks type safety  
**Estimated Time:** 2.5 weeks  
**Description:** Guardian has 13+ TypeScript `any` type warnings in critical healthcare components, removing type safety protections for medical data processing and patient information handling.  
**Context Documentation:** [Frontend Implementation](../architecture/frontend/implementation/)  
**Dependencies:** None - can be implemented independently  
**Code Quality:** Patient safety type validations needed

### [Issue #32](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/32) - ⚡ Edge Runtime Compatibility
**Urgency:** ⚠️ **MEDIUM**  
**Healthcare Impact:** MEDIUM - Real-time features but has fallback  
**Estimated Time:** 2 weeks  
**Description:** Supabase Realtime client uses Node.js-specific APIs incompatible with Vercel Edge Runtime, potentially causing failures in serverless healthcare data subscriptions.  
**Context Documentation:** [Phase 3 Advanced Features](../architecture/frontend/implementation/phase-3-advanced-features.md)  
**Dependencies:** Vercel Edge Runtime deployment testing  
**Impact:** Real-time provider dashboards may need polling fallback

### [Issue #33](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/33) - 🛡️ CSP Middleware Header Conflict
**Urgency:** ⚠️ **MEDIUM**  
**Healthcare Impact:** LOW - Security configuration bug  
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour  
**Description:** Content Security Policy headers are incorrectly applied to API routes, causing header conflicts and potential security misconfigurations. Discovered by GPT-5 technical review.  
**Context Documentation:** [Phase 3.2 Security Implementation](../architecture/frontend/implementation/phase-3.2-implementation.md)  
**Dependencies:** None - simple middleware fix  
**Technical Fix:** Remove duplicate CSP header sources

### [Issue #35](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/35) - 🔄 Magic Link Auth Cross-Tab Synchronization
**Urgency:** ⚠️ **MEDIUM**  
**Healthcare Impact:** HIGH - User experience confusion reduces healthcare professional confidence  
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Description:** When users sign in via magic link, the original browser tab remains inaccessible after successful authentication in the new tab. Users must manually refresh to access dashboard, creating confusing UX.  
**Context Documentation:** Related to Issue #25 auth flow architecture and middleware behavior  
**Dependencies:** Understanding of Supabase auth state management and middleware integration  
**Technical Fix:** Implement cross-tab auth state detection via Supabase auth listener or polling

### ✅ [Issue #36](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/36) - 🚨 File Upload System Failures **[RESOLVED]**
**Status:** ✅ **CLOSED** (August 18, 2025)  
**Root Cause:** Multi-layered issues requiring systematic resolution  
**Actual Problems Fixed:**
- **PRIMARY**: PostgREST schema routing (client configuration added `schema: 'public'`)
- **SECONDARY**: Database permission gaps (grants applied for `anon` and `authenticated` roles)
- **INFRASTRUCTURE**: PostgreSQL function overload conflicts resolved, edge function parameter fixes
**Additional Improvements:** Storage policy security (authenticated-only), CSP configuration restored
**Business Impact:** Core document upload functionality fully operational, security enhanced

### ✅ [Issue #34](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/34) - 🔧 Node.js Version Conflict **[RESOLVED]**
**Status:** ✅ **CLOSED** (August 18, 2025)  
**Root Cause:** Investigation revealed Node version was NOT causing CI failures  
**Actual Problems Fixed:**
- **PRIMARY**: TypeScript compilation errors in validation tests (discriminated union type guards)
- **SECONDARY**: Missing Supabase auth mocking (`supabase.auth.getSession()` crashes)
- **INFRASTRUCTURE**: Implemented production-quality testing patterns with centralized utilities
**Additional Improvements:** Type safety, dependency injection, resilient test assertions
**Node Version Status:** Real issue but LOW priority quality improvement (warnings only)
