## üö® CRITICAL Priority Issues

### [Issue #38](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/38) - üîß ID System Architecture Alignment
**Urgency:** üö® **CRITICAL**  
**Healthcare Impact:** CRITICAL - Multiple ID system inconsistencies risk data contamination and security vulnerabilities  
**Estimated Time:** 4 weeks (systematic architectural fix)  
**Description:** Database schema, TypeScript interfaces, and application logic have misaligned ID semantics. Clinical tables claim to reference `auth.users(id)` but actually store `user_profiles.id` values, creating confusion between account owner ID, profile ID, and patient ID concepts.  
**Context Documentation:** 
- [CLAUDE.md ID Semantics](../../../CLAUDE.md#id-semantics-and-data-access-patterns) - Current documentation with gaps
- [AI Processing V3 schemas](../architecture/ai-processing-v3/) - May inherit inconsistencies  
- [Patient Communications ID System](../architecture/patient-communications/identification-system.md) - Future external ID architecture (orthogonal to this internal issue)  
**Dependencies:** Database schema corrections, TypeScript type alignment, frontend component updates  
**Security Risk:** Profile contamination, unauthorized medical record access, audit trail confusion  
**Compliance Risk:** Australian Privacy Act violations due to improper patient data isolation  
**Technical Debt:** RPC functions contain dual-path workarounds, branded types missing despite documentation references

### [Issue #39](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/39) - üö® AI Pass 1 Validation System - Prevent Silent Clinical Data Loss
**Urgency:** üö® **CRITICAL**  
**Healthcare Impact:** CRITICAL - AI misclassification can permanently lose clinical data without detection  
**Estimated Time:** 3 weeks (mandatory validation system implementation)  
**Description:** V3 AI processing pipeline's Pass 1 entity classification can silently drop clinical data if entities are misclassified as `document_structure`. Need code-based validation scoring, keyword safety nets, and manual review queue to prevent silent medical data loss.  
**Context Documentation:** 
- [V3 AI Processing Architecture](../architecture/ai-processing-v3/v3-pipeline-planning/04-ai-processing-architecture.md) - Two-pass system vulnerabilities
- [V2 TO V3 Integration](../architecture/ai-processing-v3/V2_TO_V3_ARCHITECTURE_INTEGRATION.md) - Safety requirements  
**Dependencies:** V3 AI processing pipeline, entity_processing_audit table, admin dashboard framework  
**Security Risk:** Critical medical information permanently lost during AI processing  
**Compliance Risk:** Australian Privacy Act requires complete medical record accuracy and loss prevention  
**Patient Safety:** Missing medication/diagnostic data could impact treatment decisions

### [Issue #40](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/40) - üõ°Ô∏è Profile Access Security Function - Fix RLS Policy Vulnerability
**Urgency:** üö® **CRITICAL**  
**Healthcare Impact:** CRITICAL - Current RLS policies ignore granular permissions, allowing unauthorized profile access  
**Estimated Time:** 3 weeks (security function implementation + policy migration)  
**Description:** Row Level Security policies only check account ownership, completely ignoring `profile_access_permissions` table. Missing `has_profile_access()` function creates vulnerability where shared profile access is not enforced. All clinical data tables need RLS policy updates.  
**Context Documentation:** 
- [Multi-Profile Management](../../../supabase/migrations/003_multi_profile_management.sql) - Current vulnerable policies
- [Issue #28 RLS Testing](https://github.com/xavierjflanagan/Guardian/issues/28) - Testing framework for validation  
**Dependencies:** Issue #38 (ID System Architecture), profile_access_permissions table structure  
**Security Risk:** Unauthorized access to family member medical records, cross-profile data contamination  
**Compliance Risk:** Australian Privacy Act + HIPAA violations for inadequate access controls  
**Business Risk:** Data breach liability and regulatory sanctions
