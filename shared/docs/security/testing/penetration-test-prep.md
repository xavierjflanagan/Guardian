# Penetration Testing Preparation

**Purpose:** External security audit preparation for Guardian healthcare platform  
**Status:** Planned for pre-production phase  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-13

## Overview

This document outlines preparation steps for external penetration testing. Full documentation will be developed when engaging security auditors.

## Scope

### In-Scope Systems
- Guardian web application (custom domain)
- API endpoints and Edge Functions
- Authentication flows (magic links)
- Database access controls (RLS policies)
- File upload and processing pipeline

### Out-of-Scope
- Supabase infrastructure (covered by their SOC 2)
- Vercel infrastructure (covered by their compliance)
- Third-party services (OpenAI, Google Cloud)

## Pre-Test Requirements

### Documentation Needed
- [ ] Application architecture diagram
- [ ] API endpoint inventory
- [ ] Authentication flow documentation
- [ ] Data flow diagrams
- [ ] Known security measures

### Test Accounts
- [ ] Create dedicated test user accounts
- [ ] Provide test medical documents (synthetic data)
- [ ] Configure test provider accounts
- [ ] Set up multi-profile test scenarios

### Environment Preparation
- [ ] Staging environment with production-like configuration
- [ ] Monitoring and logging enabled
- [ ] Backup procedures verified
- [ ] Incident response team notified

## Testing Methodology

### OWASP Top 10 Coverage
- Injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, Command)
- Broken authentication
- Sensitive data exposure
- XML external entities (XXE)
- Broken access control
- Security misconfiguration
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Insecure deserialization
- Using components with known vulnerabilities
- Insufficient logging and monitoring

### Healthcare-Specific Testing
- PHI data isolation between profiles
- Provider access control validation
- Audit trail integrity testing
- Emergency access procedures
- Medical data integrity verification

## Timeline

### Pre-Test Phase (2 weeks before)
- Week 1: Documentation preparation
- Week 2: Test account setup and environment preparation

### Testing Phase (1-2 weeks)
- Active testing by external auditor
- Daily status updates
- Immediate critical issue notification

### Post-Test Phase (1 week)
- Report review and validation
- Remediation planning
- Retest scheduling if needed

## Success Criteria

- No critical vulnerabilities affecting PHI
- No high-severity authentication bypasses
- All findings documented with remediation plan
- Compliance requirements validated
