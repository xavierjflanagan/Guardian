## **HIPAA Overview**

HIPAA establishes national standards for protecting individuals' medical records and other personal health information. For Guardian's US expansion, we must ensure compliance with HIPAA Privacy Rule, Security Rule, and Breach Notification Rule.

### **HIPAA Rules Overview**
- **Privacy Rule:** How PHI can be used and disclosed
- **Security Rule:** Administrative, physical, and technical safeguards
- **Breach Notification Rule:** Requirements for notifying breaches of PHI
- **Enforcement Rule:** Penalties and enforcement procedures

### **Guardian's HIPAA Status**
As a technology platform that stores and processes Protected Health Information (PHI), Guardian would be classified as either:
- **Covered Entity** (if providing healthcare services directly)
- **Business Associate** (if providing services to covered entities)

*Initial assessment: Likely Business Associate status*
