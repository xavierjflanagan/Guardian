## **Response Procedures**

### **Phase 1: Detection and Initial Response (0-1 Hour)**

#### **1.1 Incident Detection**
Detection sources:
- [ ] Automated security monitoring alerts
- [ ] User reports of suspicious activity
- [ ] System performance anomalies
- [ ] Third-party security notifications
- [ ] Routine security assessments

#### **1.2 Initial Assessment**
```typescript
// Incident triage checklist
interface IncidentTriage {
  severity: 'P0' | 'P1' | 'P2' | 'P3';
  phi_involved: boolean;
  users_affected: number;
  systems_compromised: string[];
  ongoing_threat: boolean;
  notification_required: boolean;
}

const triageIncident = (report: IncidentReport): IncidentTriage => {
  return {
    severity: assessSeverity(report),
    phi_involved: identifyPHIInvolvement(report),
    users_affected: countAffectedUsers(report),
    systems_compromised: identifyCompromisedSystems(report),
    ongoing_threat: assessOngoingThreat(report),
    notification_required: determineNotificationRequirement(report)
  };
};
