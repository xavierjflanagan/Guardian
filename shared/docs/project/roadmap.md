**Current Status:** Multi-provider architecture in development for GPT-4o Mini, Google Document AI, and Azure Document Intelligence to enable cost/quality optimization and A/B testing.

### **ðŸš§ Pillar 4: Multi-Provider AI Framework** - **IN PROGRESS (Target: July 25)**
**Scope:** Flexible multi-provider document processing with cost/quality optimization
**Updated Requirements:**
- **Primary Provider:** GPT-4o Mini ($0.15/1M tokens) - Cost-effective with semantic understanding
- **Premium Providers:** Google Document AI, Azure Document Intelligence - Layout preservation
- **Fallback Provider:** AWS Textract - Current working integration
- **A/B Testing Framework:** Provider selection and comparison dashboard
- **Cost Optimization:** Dynamic provider selection based on document complexity

**AI Prompt Engineering:**
```
Extract medical information from this document text:
- Medications (name, dosage, frequency, dates)
- Allergies (substance, reaction type, severity)
- Medical conditions (diagnosis, dates, status)
- Procedures (name, date, outcome)
- Test results (test name, values, dates, reference ranges)

For each extracted item, provide:
1. Exact text from source document
2. Justification for medical relevance
3. Confidence score (0-100)
4. Suggested metadata tags
```

### **ðŸš§ Pillar 5: Medical Data Storage** - **PENDING (Target: July 28)**
**Scope:** Sophisticated medical data storage with comprehensive metadata
**Requirements:**
- **Data Source Traceability:** Link back to exact location on original document
- **AI Justification:** Record why AI deemed information medically relevant
- **Comprehensive Metadata Tagging:**
  - Primary categories: 'medication', 'allergy', 'condition', 'procedure', 'test_result'
  - Health profile mapping: Where data appears on user health profile
  - Cross-referencing: Single data point appearing in multiple profile sections
  - Temporal data: Current vs historical information
  - Confidence scoring: AI confidence in extraction accuracy

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE medical_data (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  document_id UUID REFERENCES documents(id),
  
  -- Extracted content
  extracted_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  medical_category TEXT NOT NULL, -- medication, allergy, condition, etc.
  
  -- Source traceability
  source_location JSONB, -- page, coordinates, exact text location
  ai_justification TEXT NOT NULL,
  confidence_score INTEGER CHECK (confidence_score >= 0 AND confidence_score <= 100),
  
  -- Metadata tagging
  primary_tags TEXT[] NOT NULL,
  health_profile_sections TEXT[] NOT NULL, -- where this appears on profile
  temporal_status TEXT, -- current, historical, one-time
  
  -- AI processing info
  ai_model_used TEXT NOT NULL,
  processing_cost DECIMAL,
  extraction_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Example Data Point:**
```json
{
  "extracted_text": "Salbutamol inhaler 100mcg, 2 puffs as needed for asthma",
  "medical_category": "medication",
  "source_location": {
    "page": 2,
    "coordinates": [120, 450, 380, 470],
    "surrounding_text": "Current medications: Salbutamol inhaler..."
  },
  "ai_justification": "Text contains medication name, dosage, frequency, and indication - clearly medical prescription information",
  "confidence_score": 95,
  "primary_tags": ["medication", "respiratory", "bronchodilator"],
  "health_profile_sections": ["current_medications", "medication_history", "respiratory_conditions"],
  "temporal_status": "current"
}
```

### **ðŸš§ Pillar 6: Health Profile Interface** - **PENDING (Target: July 31)**
**Scope:** User-facing health profile with factual medical information display
**Requirements:**
- **Factual Information Priority:** No AI interpretation in primary view
- **Modular Display Format:** Structured sections for different medical categories
- **AI Attribution:** Clear labeling when content is "AI-generated/interpreted"
- **Professional Source Priority:** Verbatim from qualified health professionals
- **User-Friendly Organization:** Intuitive navigation and information hierarchy

**Health Profile Sections:**
1. **Current Medications**
   - Active prescriptions with dosages
   - Source document references
   - AI confidence indicators
2. **Allergies & Reactions**
   - Known allergies with severity levels
   - Reaction descriptions
   - Date of discovery/documentation
3. **Medical History**
   - Past and current conditions
   - Diagnosis dates and sources
   - Treatment outcomes
4. **Test Results**
   - Laboratory values with reference ranges
   - Imaging results and interpretations
   - Trend analysis over time
5. **Procedures & Surgeries**
   - Surgical history with dates
