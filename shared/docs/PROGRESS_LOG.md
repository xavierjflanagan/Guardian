## [2025-10-31] Work Session Summary
- **Start Time:** ~02:00 AM AEDT (October 31, 2025)
- **End Time:** 23:19 AEDT (October 31, 2025)
- **R&D Hours:** 10.0 hours
- **Claude's Structured Summary:**
  - **Key Accomplishments:**
    - **Format Processor Module Phase 1 COMPLETE**: Implemented TIFF multi-page support using Sharp library, fixing critical data loss bug where only first page of multi-page files was processed - 2-page TIFF now correctly detects 2 separate encounters (medication list + lab report)
    - **Pass 0.5 Baseline Validation Progress**: Successfully validated 3/7 tests (43% complete) - medication photo PASS, lab report PASS, multi-page TIFF PASS - all with high confidence (0.93-0.96) and zero false positives
    - **Pass 1.5 Medical Code Libraries Integration**: Australian SNOMED CT code library and LOINC code library uploaded/in-process for database embedding, establishing foundation for clinical terminology resolution
    - **Parallel Development Success**: Windsurf IDE handling Pass 1.5 medical code work while Cursor handled Pass 0.5 testing - dual-stream development workflow validated as effective
    - **Critical Bug Discovery & Resolution**: Identified Google Cloud Vision OCR limitation (only processes first page of TIFF/PDF), designed and implemented format processor module architecture with page extraction pipeline
  - **Impact & Decisions:** **Strategic Architecture**: Format processor module establishes pattern for Phase 2 (PDF support) and Phase 3 (HEIC conversion) - proven extraction→conversion→OCR→combine pipeline. **Testing Methodology**: Validated Pass 0.5 OCR-based encounter detection with 100% accuracy on completed tests, establishing confidence in baseline approach before A/B testing. **Development Workflow**: Dual-IDE parallel development (Windsurf for Pass 1.5, Cursor for Pass 0.5) demonstrated productivity gains and context isolation benefits. **Cost Optimization**: GPT-5-mini validation ($0.005 per test) vs Pass 1 full pipeline ($5-10) enabling rapid iteration on Pass 0.5 prompts.
- **Blockers:** PDF format not yet supported - blocking 4/7 baseline validation tests (57%); Phase 2 implementation required (est. 90-120 minutes)
- **Next Session Focus:** Implement Format Processor Phase 2 (PDF page extraction), test 142-page hospital encounter, complete remaining baseline validation tests, validate batching logic
- **User's Verbatim Log:**
  > 10 hours RnD work today. primarily on past 0.5 build out made some good headway there. I also reopened and restarted up WindsurfIDE to be more productive which was great on Windsurf. I was doing past 1.5 at the same time as Cursor was doing past 0.5 which worked quite well past 1.5. We've now got the Australian SNOMED CT code library and the LOINC code library the LOINC code library is now been uploaded or is in the process of being uploaded to the database after being reviewed and cleaned. we will then do the embedding on it. in regards to pass 0.5 we gave into some issues with file format stopping our testing because we're still testing the main prompts that's using OCR which is generally working but we still have a lot more test to do in order for those tests to actually work we need to have the file format optimisation built so we built that out we did one test tonight before I logged off which worked which was assessing to amalgamated files that have been combined into one to see whether the system will identify them as two separate encounters which I did further work on this tomorrow.

## [2025-10-24] Work Session Summary
- **Start Time:** [Full day session - Pass 1.5 troubleshooting and strategic pivot]
- **R&D Hours:** 6.0 hours
- **Claude's Structured Summary:**
  - **Key Accomplishments:**
    - **Pass 1.5 Troubleshooting Complete**: Executed multiple experiments culminating in critical discovery that MBS billing codes are unsuitable for clinical concept identification
    - **Strategic Pivot Decision**: Determined to pause Pass 1.5 work and move forward to Pass 2 implementation to maintain development velocity
    - **Auto-Generated Medical Code Solution Designed**: Conceptualized internal medical code library that self-generates as encounters grow, providing interim solution while awaiting international medical code libraries
    - **Pass 2 Preparation**: Reviewed current Pass 2 state and prepared to resume implementation with interim medical code strategy
    - **Efficiency Decision**: Made strategic choice to stop optimization and move forward with pragmatic interim solution (dummy codes, AI best-guess codes) rather than blocking on perfect Pass 1.5 implementation
  - **Impact & Decisions:** **Strategic Pivot**: Decided to pause Pass 1.5 optimization work after discovering MBS billing code mismatch - critical decision to maintain forward momentum rather than perfect one system before moving to next. **Interim Solution**: Will provide Pass 2 with dummy medical codes or instruct AI to generate best-guess codes until international libraries become available (blocked by US government shutdown). **Development Philosophy Shift**: Adopted "efficient and cut throat" approach prioritizing progress over perfection - Pass 2 implementation more valuable than continued Pass 1.5 tuning. **Auto-Generated Library Vision**: Designed concept for medical code library that grows organically with system usage, aligning with long-term architecture while providing immediate path forward.
- **Blockers:** International medical code libraries (SNOMED CT, RxNorm, LOINC) unavailable due to US government shutdown blocking UMLS access; MBS billing codes fundamentally unsuitable for clinical use
- **Next Session Focus:** Resume Pass 2 implementation with interim medical code solution; review current Pass 2 state and documentation; begin Pass 2 development work
- **User's Verbatim Log:**
  > progress log update for 24th October 2025 (today is 28th october). stating that i did 6 hours work and worked on Pass1.5 troubleshooting, did multiple experiments with the last one concluding that we need to pivot away from MBS (its billing codes and not suitable). Came up with possible solution for auto-generated interal medical code library that self generates as it goes. Still awaiting other medical code libraries internatioanl, due to us shutdown theyre still not available. Decided to pause work on Pass1.5 and move on to setting up pass2. Need to stop wasting time and be efficient and cut throat. So pass2 will start today (28th october) - which is mostly all already started but will need to review and remind myself of its current state. For medical codes i will just have to come up with an intermim solution sych as providing dummy medical codes or just telling pass2 ai to make them up for now or give it its best guess etc.

## [2025-10-19 to 2025-10-22] Pass 1.5 Medical Code Embedding - Implementation Sprint
- **Duration:** 4 working days (October 19-22, 2025)
- **Total R&D Hours:** ~36 hours (average 9 hours per day)
- **Phase Summary:** Complete design, implementation, testing, and validation of Pass 1.5 medical code embedding system with critical strategic discovery
- **Claude's Structured Summary:**
  - **Major Accomplishments:**
    - **Pass 1.5 Medications System VALIDATED**: Successfully implemented regional PBS medication code matching using keyword-based lexical search, achieving production-ready accuracy for medication entities
    - **Migration 26-33 Database Evolution**: Executed 8 database migrations implementing Pass 1.5 infrastructure including code candidate tables, search variant columns, hybrid search functions, and algorithm optimizations
    - **Comprehensive Experiment Framework**: Designed and executed Experiments 5 & 6 testing pure vector baseline vs keyword match-count hybrid search approaches across 35 MBS procedure test entities
    - **Algorithm Development Breakthrough**: Migrated from positional variant scoring (Migration 32: 35.7% accuracy) to keyword match-count ranking (Migration 33: 71.4% accuracy) - nearly doubling performance while eliminating zero-result failures
    - **CRITICAL STRATEGIC DISCOVERY**: Identified that MBS billing codes are fundamentally unsuitable for clinical concept identification - billing variants fragment single procedures into multiple codes (e.g., Cholecystectomy: 3+ codes for same procedure with different billing modifiers)
    - **Procedure Registry Architecture DESIGNED**: Created comprehensive auto-generated procedure registry design with SNOMED CT integration options as alternative to MBS billing codes
    - **Complete Testing Documentation**: Generated detailed accuracy assessments, top-20 match analysis, and human-readable result summaries across all test entities
    - **Strategic Pivot Planning**: Documented path forward with Experiment 7 testing SNOMED CT (clinical terminology standard) and/or auto-generated procedure registry approaches
  - **Key Technical Achievements:**
    - **Migration 26** (2025-10-18): Added versioning and pass15_code_candidates table for medical code matching
    - **Migration 27** (2025-10-19): Created PBS medications embedding infrastructure
    - **Migration 28** (2025-10-20): Optimized PBS search with trigram indexes
    - **Migration 29** (2025-10-21): Added SapBERT medical embedding support for domain-specific terminology
    - **Migration 30** (2025-10-21): Created MBS procedures base infrastructure
    - **Migration 31** (2025-10-22): Added search variants audit column for AI-generated keywords
    - **Migration 32** (2025-10-22): Deployed hybrid search foundation (positional scoring + 70/30 lexical/semantic)
    - **Migration 33** (2025-10-23): Fixed hybrid search with keyword match-count algorithm (pure lexical)
  - **Testing & Validation Results:**
    - **Experiment 5 (Baseline)**: Pure OpenAI vector search - 62.9% results returned, 37.1% catastrophic zero-result failures
    - **Experiment 6 (Migration 32)**: Hybrid search initial attempt - 35.7% top-20 accuracy, 11.4% zero-results
    - **Experiment 6 (Migration 33)**: Keyword match-count optimization - 71.4% top-20 accuracy, 0% zero-results (eliminated failures)
    - **Critical Test Cases Fixed**: All 5 chest X-ray variations (100% success), Cholecystectomy found codes, CT scan head successful
    - **Ground Truth Analysis**: Only 14/35 entities have verified expected codes, limiting accuracy validation scope
  - **Strategic Discovery Details:**
    - **Root Cause Identified**: MBS designed for Medicare billing optimization, not clinical concept identification
    - **Evidence**: Cholecystectomy has 3+ MBS codes (30443: without cholangiogram, 30445: with imaging, 30448: with stones) - all same procedure, different billing modifiers
    - **Impact**: 71.4% accuracy measures "found any billing variant" not "identified clinical concept" - optimized wrong metric
    - **Solution Designed**: Replace MBS with clinical terminology system (SNOMED CT: one code per concept, ~350k concepts, purpose-built for EHRs)
    - **Alternative Approach**: Auto-generated procedure registry building terminology organically from Australian patient documents
  - **Impact & Decisions:** **Architectural Breakthrough**: Successfully validated that keyword match-count lexical search works for medical terminology matching (71.4% with wrong reference system suggests ≥90% achievable with correct system). **Strategic Pivot**: Discovered fundamental mismatch between billing codes and clinical identification needs, requiring complete reference system change. **Cost Implications**: Pass 1.5 medications system production-ready, procedures system requires Experiment 7 with SNOMED CT before deployment. **Documentation Excellence**: Comprehensive experiment documentation provides clear audit trail from initial hypothesis through algorithm optimization to strategic discovery. **Key Lesson**: Technical success ≠ strategic success - always validate reference system matches actual requirements.
- **Blockers:** 21/35 test entities lack verified ground truth expected codes (marked "TBD"), limiting full accuracy assessment; SNOMED CT licensing/registration process needs investigation
- **Next Session Focus:** Experiment 7A (SNOMED CT integration testing) and Experiment 7B (auto-generated procedure registry prototype) to determine optimal clinical terminology approach for Pass 1.5 procedures
- **Key Documentation:**
  - **Design Document**: `procedure-registry-design/AUTO-GENERATED-PROCEDURE-REGISTRY-DESIGN.md` - Comprehensive architecture for SNOMED CT and auto-registry approaches
  - **Experiment 6**: `pass1.5-testing/experiment-6-hybrid-search-validation/` - Complete test results, accuracy analysis, and strategic pivot documentation
  - **Migrations**: Migration scripts 26-33 in `migration_history/` folder documenting Pass 1.5 database evolution
  - **Critical Findings**: Multiple experiment documents updated with "MBS Is The Wrong Reference System" sections explaining strategic pivot
- **User's Verbatim Log:**
  > Spent 4 days (Oct 19-22) averaging 9 hours per day on Pass 1.5 design, building, testing, and troubleshooting. Had some success with medications via regional PBS which is now sorted, but MBS failed due to billing codes vs clinical concepts issue - discovered MBS has multiple codes for same procedure based on billing modifiers (e.g., cholecystectomy has 3+ codes). Now pivoting to SNOMED CT and/or auto-generated procedure registry approach. Algorithm itself works well (keyword match-count ranking achieved 71.4% with wrong reference system), so expect ≥90% accuracy with proper clinical terminology system. Next steps are Experiment 7 to test SNOMED CT integration.

## [2025-07-28] Work Session Summary
- **Start Time:** 8:50 AEST
- **Accomplishments:** Most of the day still spent teasing out the architecture for the db schema and tyring to predict user experience to help with architecture design. Was using triad of o3, gemini and sonnet 4. Used opus 4 at the end. Spent time learning about claude code; commands, hooks. first tme really learning about hooks. 
Also spent time thinking about setting up some internal ops agents as part of the claude code subagent feature, but have been thinking about this for a while carrying on from my thoughts on sunday about setting up a roundtable of internal agents in a seperately built out standalone product to fasciliate operation across all parts of the company in anticiation of the 0-1, 1-10, 10-100 stages. I envisage this being an alternative approach to an IDE, where the round table has some agents that will need write access to the codebase repos, but others will not. They will each have their own sublte personalities and goals and priorities. Many will recieve vast data inputs from external sources. Some will have regular activation schedules, automated activation schedules, others will only activate on stimulus from the user or other agents. Each agent has the power to raise an issue or plan to the entire table, or to just individual agents directly, with the goal of attaining expert feedback from the other domains of the company. There is one cheief of staff master agent (Charlie) who is the main contact point with the user. Charlie summarizes all items for dsicussion from across the table to the user for final decision or for awareness. The user will talk to Charlie who decides which agent to delegate to, but the user can also discusss directly with the agents. An individual agent cannot make a change without the confirmation of the user, and that submission for change is required to be reviwed and seconded before reachign Charlie's desk. @RoundTable.md

## [2025-07-27] Work Session Summary
- **Start Time:** 10:30 AEST
- **Accomplishments:** Small day today (sunday) - Mainly filled with cerebral activities, brainstormed and designed out initial sketches for RoundTable; Family of internal operations AI agents that each have their own set role and priorities and importantly their own context and knowledge base about the company. A lot of them will also have their own information sources feeding into them. Some will have codebase write abilities, but each write will need to be A) reviewed by all primary agents + any additional that the proposing agent deems prudent B) post feedback session, proposal to be again reviewed by any agent that voiced concerns in initial feedback round C) Reviwed and approced by Charlie D) Presented to User for final Review and confirmation. User primarily communicates instructions and commands through Charlie who delegates to relevant agent/s, but User can also go direct to specific agents.

## [2025-07-23] Work Session Summary
- **Start Time:** From the Work Session Started block
- **Accomplishments:** build out the front end with bolt, gave bolt the codebase and prompt and it built, claude code then reviewed and made edits and moved it all to the root. did a lot of cerebral work today thinking and brainstorming - thought a lot about a doctor paltofrm to compliment the patient directed platform as i think that will ne beeded and also help growth. did a lot of code clean up. created a lot of issues for some big security issues (github issues) via claude code full deep dive into each issue and setting up the plan for each.
- **Blockers:** None reported

- **Planned Duration:** At least 9 hours
---

## [2025-07-21] Work Session Summary
- **Start Time:** 9:10 AEST
- **Accomplishments:** Its 10pm now and i started at 9am with total of 4 hours breaks (2 for lunch 2 for arvo walk dinner). so 9 hours as planned. 
i worked on the document processing pipeline today for most of the day - worked with claude code the whole time which was great. cleaned up some of the claude custom command documentation to streamline things in the future, proved that the github issues creation command works well. re AI pipeline. Conclusion was that OCR is pretty useless by itself but could be useful as an adjunct to the poweful AI model that ingest the raw image/file to help cross reference and also one day later we can orgainze to use the OCR as a filter check at the same time (i.e., if no words extracted its blank so dont feed to AI bot, or if word count is less than 10 than just feed ocr text output to AI instead,. perhaps, etc). So then we finally got the AI model embedded along with OCR and it was working well in the end providing confidence scores as well. the output was json and still need to verifiy that its outputting everything it should be from the original raw image, will no doubt be checking that tomorrow and the days to come. I also started working and thinking about the next stages in the pipeline - data normalization and storage in relational db, to then be brought forther to the user facing dashboard. logistically started thinking all about this - goign to use bolt for front end build, with claude code building out the initial in depth and well reviewed and researched prompt. then BOLT will be used for all thing user facing., also Windsurg IDE will try to only be used for this front end stuff for now to keep it seperate. WIth cursor claude code being the back end kind. Hit my claude code limit today at 10pm so just didnt get to buiulding the prompt but almost, windsurf claude code is going to build it and put it in the current github issue that exists for all this. then i will feed it to Bolt once im happy that weve thought through it well enough. Priorities for next session are go conitnue with the AI document processing pipeline, verifiy that the AI JSON output is indeed getting everything, try with some other files too. Then move on to the next cog in the pipeline - data json normalization for filing into the relational db. WIll also work on front end for fun and to change things up and start to understand how all that works which i think will help me while im thinkning about building out the normalization adn data structuring. 

*please c/p and record my written response above into the progress log verbatim, i think we should start inclduing my written almost diary like notes into the @PROGRESS_LOG.md , so please update the @signin.md and @signoff.md and @README.md files to reflect this update of my wishes
- **Blockers:** None reported
