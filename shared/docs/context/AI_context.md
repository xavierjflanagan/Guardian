## 1. Project Goal

Build a prototype of "Guardian," an AI-powered healthcare app for uploading, analyzing, and managing medical records. The app should deliver a "wow-factor" UX and be maintainable, initially, by a solo developer. For a full overview, see the [Project Overview](../getting-started/overview.md).

## 2. Tech Stack & Architecture

The project uses a modern, scalable, and solo-dev friendly stack.

- **Core Stack:** Next.js, Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage), and Vercel for deployment.
- **Architecture:** The system is designed with a modular, pluggable document processing pipeline.

For complete details, please refer to the following documents:

**Progress:**
- Supabase Auth fully implemented: magic link sign-in replaces Clerk, with route protection via middleware.
- File upload helper and UI integrated: authenticated users can upload medical documents to Supabase Storage, with RLS and per-user bucket policies.
- Modular pipeline architecture documented in `docs/architecture/pipeline.md`, summarizing the pluggable, vendor-agnostic design and next steps.
- Linter and TypeScript errors resolved; project structure and config cleaned up for maintainability.

**Decisions:**
- All authentication and storage flows now use Supabase (see [ADR-0001](../decisions/0001-supabase-vs-neon.md)).
- Clerk and legacy auth code fully removed.
- `@` alias configured for imports; all source, config, and dependency files are tracked in git.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement the pluggable `document-processor` endpoint (Supabase Edge Function or Cloudflare Worker).
- Benchmark cold-start, latency, and cost for each compute option.
- Document RLS policies and Auth plan in a new `docs/security/rls-auth.md` file.

**Blockers/Open Questions:**
- None at this time. Ready to proceed with pipeline implementation and benchmarking.

### Previous Session (2025-07-03)

- **Repository:** Cleaned and force-pushed to GitHub.
- **File Structure:** Re-organized for clarity (`app/(auth)`, `app/(main)`, etc.).
- **Docs:** Key architectural decisions and setup guides were created. See [ADR-0001](../decisions/0001-supabase-vs-neon.md) and the [Supabase Setup Guide](../guides/supabase-setup.md).
