## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Intelligent Document Routing (Week 1-2) - **CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS**
Format support that prevents 10-15% of upload failures:

1. **Format Detection and Smart Routing**
   - Implement intelligent document router with learning system
   - Add HEIC support for iPhone users (5-8% of uploads)
   - Office document text extraction (3-5% of uploads)
   - Archive unpacking for bulk workflows (2-3% of uploads)

2. **Fast Path Optimization**
   - Direct text extraction for clean PDFs (<500ms)
   - Rendering fallback for complex formats
   - Quality preservation validation

### Phase 2: Mega-AI Processing (Week 3-4) - **CORE FUNCTIONALITY**
Single-call comprehensive medical analysis:

1. **Healthcare Relevance Gate**
   - Early termination for non-medical content
   - Confidence threshold validation

2. **Comprehensive Medical Analysis**
   - Complete O3 two-axis classification in single AI call
   - Healthcare standards integration (SNOMED-CT/LOINC/CPT)
   - Timeline metadata and smart feature detection
   - Profile ownership suggestion (not assignment)

### Phase 3: Safe Profile Assignment (Week 5-6) - **FAMILY SAFETY**
Zero-risk profile contamination prevention:

1. **Deferred Assignment Workflow**
   - Process medical data before profile assignment
   - Confidence-based routing for assignment decisions
   - Holding area for unconfirmed clinical data

2. **User Confirmation Interface**
   - Present profile suggestions to users
   - Handle new profile creation workflows
   - Conditional database population after confirmation

### Phase 3: Healthcare Compliance (3-4 days)
Session tracking and audit:

1. **Processing Sessions**
   - Track all API costs and durations
   - Populate `ai_processing_sessions` table
   
2. **Quality Metrics**
   - Extraction completeness scoring
   - Confidence tracking per fact

### Phase 4: Normalization Pipeline (4-5 days)
Database population engine:

1. **JSON to Clinical Tables**
   - Parse rich AI extraction JSON
   - Insert into `patient_conditions`, `patient_allergies`, etc.
   
2. **Relationship Detection**
   - Link medications to conditions
   - Populate `medical_data_relationships`

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (3-4 days)
Healthcare-grade quality assurance:

1. **Multi-Document Testing**
   - Lab results, prescriptions, discharge summaries
   - Veterinary documents for pet profiles
   
2. **Standards Compliance**
   - Validate clinical code accuracy
   - Test timeline generation

## Critical Database Tables We Populate

### Core Clinical Tables
```sql
patient_clinical_events     -- O3's two-axis classification
patient_observations        -- Lab results, vitals, assessments  
patient_interventions       -- Medications, procedures, vaccinations
patient_conditions          -- Diagnoses with ICD-10 codes
patient_allergies          -- Allergies with severity
```

### Provenance & Tracking
```sql
clinical_fact_sources      -- Links facts to documents with spatial data
ai_processing_sessions     -- Complete processing audit trail
medical_data_relationships -- Relationships between clinical entities
```

### User Experience Tables
```sql
healthcare_timeline_events -- Timeline metadata for UI
smart_health_features      -- Auto-activating UI features
user_profiles             -- Multi-profile support
```

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Database-First Design
Every AI extraction component is designed to populate specific database tables with the exact structure and constraints required by the database foundation.

### 2. Multi-Profile Safety
Documents are classified to the correct profile (self/child/adult_dependent/pet) with contamination prevention to ensure data integrity.

### 3. Clinical Standards Compliance
All medical data is enriched with healthcare standard codes (SNOMED-CT, LOINC, CPT) for interoperability.

### 4. Complete Provenance
Every extracted fact is traceable to its source document with spatial coordinates (Phase 2+) and confidence scores.

### 5. Timeline Integration
Every clinical event generates timeline metadata for the patient's healthcare journey visualization.

## Key Differences from v1 (MVP)

| Aspect | v1 (Current) | v2 (Required) |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Scope** | Single-user, basic extraction | Multi-profile, enterprise healthcare |
| **Classification** | Simple categorization | O3's two-axis clinical model |
| **Standards** | Plain text | SNOMED-CT/LOINC/CPT codes |
| **Spatial** | None | PostGIS coordinates for provenance |
| **Timeline** | None | Full healthcare journey metadata |
| **Profiles** | Single user | self/child/adult_dependent/pet |
