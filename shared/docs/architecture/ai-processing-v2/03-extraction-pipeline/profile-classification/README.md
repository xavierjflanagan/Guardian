# Profile Classification System

**Purpose:** Intelligent document-to-profile mapping for multi-profile healthcare accounts  
**Focus:** Identity verification, profile matching, and data contamination prevention  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Phase 1 foundation requirement  
**Dependencies:** Core requirements (multi-profile support), user_profiles table schema

---

## Overview

The Profile Classification system ensures uploaded documents are correctly assigned to the appropriate profile within a user's account (self, child, adult dependent, pet), preventing cross-contamination of medical records and maintaining data integrity across the healthcare platform.

### Multi-Profile Architecture
```yaml
profile_types:
  self: "Primary account holder's medical records"
  child: "Dependent children under 18 years"  
  adult_dependent: "Adult dependents (elderly parents, disabled relatives)"
  pet: "Pet medical records and veterinary documents"

classification_goals:
  accuracy: "99%+ correct profile assignment"
  security: "Zero cross-contamination between profiles"
  usability: "Minimal user intervention required"
  compliance: "Full audit trail for healthcare regulations"
```

**Output:** Structured identity data with confidence scores

**Key Capabilities:**
- Text-based identity extraction (names, DOB, Medicare numbers)
- Vision-based identity detection for challenging documents
- Multi-language support for cultural naming conventions
- Medical identifier recognition (Medicare, insurance numbers)

### 2. Profile Matching Algorithm
**Component:** [profile-matching.md](./profile-matching.md)  
**Purpose:** Match extracted identity to appropriate user profile  
**Output:** Profile assignment with confidence and reasoning

**Key Capabilities:**
- Advanced similarity scoring with multiple algorithms
- Family relationship detection (parent-child linkage)
- Nickname and name variation handling
- Confidence-based decision making with fallback options

### 3. Contamination Prevention System
**Component:** [contamination-prevention.md](./contamination-prevention.md)  
**Purpose:** Prevent medical record mixing between profiles  
**Output:** Validated profile assignments with integrity checks

**Key Capabilities:**
- Cross-profile consistency validation
- Temporal pattern analysis for unusual assignments
- Medical context validation (adult procedures for children)
- Audit trail generation for all classification decisions

## Classification Flow

### Sequential Processing Pipeline
```yaml

  input: "Uploaded document with basic metadata"
  processes:
    - "Text extraction via OCR and document parsing"
    - "Identity pattern matching (names, DOB, identifiers)"
    - "Medical context extraction for validation"
    - "Confidence scoring for extracted identity data"
  output: "Structured identity information with confidence scores"
  fallback: "User attestation request for unclear identity documents"

stage_2_profile_matching:
  input: "Extracted identity information"
  processes:
    - "Similarity scoring against all user profiles"
    - "Family relationship pattern detection"
    - "Name variation and nickname resolution"
    - "Multi-factor matching (name + DOB + identifiers)"
  output: "Ranked profile matches with reasoning"
  fallback: "Profile selection interface for ambiguous matches"

stage_3_contamination_validation:
  input: "Proposed profile assignment"
  processes:
    - "Medical context appropriateness validation"
    - "Historical pattern consistency checking"
    - "Age-appropriate medical procedure validation"

  auto_accept: 
    threshold: 0.9
    description: "High confidence single profile match"
    action: "Automatic assignment without user intervention"
    
  profile_selection:
    threshold: 0.6-0.9
    description: "Multiple viable profile matches"
    action: "Present user with ranked profile options"
    
  manual_verification:
    threshold: 0.3-0.6
    description: "Unclear identity or low confidence match"
    action: "Request user confirmation with extracted identity display"
    
  assignment_review:
    threshold: "<0.3"
    description: "No clear identity or profile match"
    action: "Manual document review and profile assignment"

special_override_conditions:
  exact_medicare_match: "Override low name similarity if Medicare number exact match"
  exact_dob_match: "Strong signal for profile assignment even with name variations"
  family_context_match: "Parent-child relationship explicitly mentioned in document"
