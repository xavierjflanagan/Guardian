# Clinical Data Normalization

**Purpose:** Transform raw medical text into structured clinical concepts with standard terminology  
**Position:** Stage 3 of the extraction pipeline  
**Dependencies:** Text extraction, clinical classification framework  
**Output:** Normalized clinical events ready for database storage

---

## Overview

Clinical data normalization is the critical transformation stage where raw medical text becomes structured clinical information. This process applies medical intelligence to identify, extract, and standardize clinical concepts using healthcare terminology standards and the O3 classification framework.

### Normalization Objectives
```yaml
primary_goals:
  standardization: "Convert varied medical terminology to consistent standards"
  structure: "Transform unstructured text to database-ready clinical events"
  enrichment: "Add healthcare codes and clinical context"
  validation: "Ensure clinical accuracy and completeness"
```

## Normalization Architecture

### Processing Components

#### 1. Medical Concept Identification
**Purpose:** Identify clinical concepts within raw medical text  
**Method:** NLP analysis with medical domain knowledge  
**Output:** Extracted medical concepts with confidence scores

```yaml
concept_types:
  clinical_events:
    - "Diagnostic procedures and tests"
    - "Therapeutic interventions"
    - "Clinical observations and measurements"
    
  anatomical_references:
    - "Body systems and organs"
    - "Anatomical sites with laterality"
    - "Spatial relationships"
    
  medical_terminology:
    - "Disease and condition names"
    - "Medication names and dosages"
    - "Medical abbreviations and acronyms"
```

#### 2. Clinical Classification Application
**Purpose:** Apply O3 two-axis classification to medical concepts  
**Method:** Activity type + clinical purposes classification  
**Output:** Events categorized by activity type and healthcare intent

```yaml
classification_application:
  activity_type_assignment:
    process: "observation vs intervention determination"
    confidence_threshold: 0.80
    validation: "Clinical logic checking"
    
  clinical_purposes_assignment:
    process: "screening, diagnostic, therapeutic, monitoring, preventive"
    multi_value_support: true
    confidence_threshold: 0.70
```

#### 3. Healthcare Standards Integration
**Purpose:** Assign standardized healthcare codes to clinical concepts  
**Method:** API integration with healthcare terminology services  
**Output:** Clinical events with SNOMED-CT, LOINC, and CPT codes

```yaml
standards_integration:
  snomed_ct:
    coverage_target: 85%
    confidence_threshold: 0.75
    validation: "Code existence and appropriateness"
    
  loinc:
    scope: "Observations and laboratory tests"
    coverage_target: 75%
    confidence_threshold: 0.70
    
  cpt:
    scope: "Procedures and services"
    coverage_target: 70%
    confidence_threshold: 0.75
```

#### 4. Event Structure Normalization
**Purpose:** Create consistent event structures for database storage  
**Method:** Template-based event construction with validation  
**Output:** Structured clinical events ready for database insertion

```yaml
event_structure:
  required_fields:
    - "event_name (normalized)"
    - "activity_type"
    - "clinical_purposes[]"
    - "patient_id"
    - "event_date"
    
  optional_fields:
    - "method"
    - "body_site"

```

## Terminology Versioning Strategy

**Objective:** To ensure long-term data integrity and interoperability, the system must manage and store the versions of the healthcare terminology standards (SNOMED-CT, LOINC, etc.) used during normalization.

**Rationale:** These standards evolve over time, with codes being added, deprecated, or redefined. Storing the version provides essential context for future data analysis, migration, and regulatory audits.

### Implementation Requirements

1.  **Schema Modification:**
    *   Any database table storing a healthcare code (e.g., `patient_clinical_events`, `patient_conditions`) MUST also include a corresponding column to store the version of that standard (e.g., `snomed_version`, `loinc_version`).
    *   Example: `snomed_code TEXT`, `snomed_version TEXT`.

2.  **Processing Logic:**
    *   The Normalization service MUST be designed to capture the terminology version during its API calls to external standards providers.
    *   This version information MUST be passed along with the code and stored in the appropriate database column.

3.  **Future Maintenance Plan:**
    *   The system should include a plan for periodic maintenance related to terminology updates.
    *   This may involve creating batch processes to identify records coded with older or deprecated standard versions and flagging them for review or potential re-normalization.
