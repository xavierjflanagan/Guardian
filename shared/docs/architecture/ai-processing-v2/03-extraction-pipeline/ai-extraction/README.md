## Future Enhancement: Iterative Refinement Loop

**Objective:** To improve extraction accuracy on complex documents, a future version of this system could incorporate a multi-pass, iterative refinement loop.

**Rationale:** While a single-pass extraction is efficient, some complex documents benefit from a second, more specialized analysis. A second pass, armed with the high-level context from the first, can achieve higher precision on detailed data points.

### Conceptual Flow

1.  **Pass 1: Context Pass**
    *   **Action:** A quick, broad analysis of the document is performed using a cost-effective model.
    *   **Goal:** To establish high-level context, such as document type, medical specialty, and primary conditions mentioned (e.g., "This is a pediatric cardiology report regarding a follow-up for an Atrial Septal Defect.").

2.  **Pass 2: Specialist Pass**
    *   **Action:** Based on the context from Pass 1, the system invokes a more specialized prompt for a second extraction pass. This could be on the entire document or targeted sections.
    *   **Example Prompt:** "You are a pediatric cardiology expert. From the following text, extract all measurements related to the Atrial Septal Defect, including shunt size, chamber dimensions, and pressure gradients."
    *   **Goal:** To achieve higher accuracy on nuanced, critical data points that might be missed or misinterpreted by a generic, single-pass extraction.
