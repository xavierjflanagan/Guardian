# Clinical Classification - AI Processing Framework

**Purpose:** Define how AI processes medical content to populate Guardian's clinical database tables  
**Focus:** O3's two-axis classification model and clinical data extraction patterns  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Phase 1 blocking components for database integration

---

## Overview

Clinical classification is the core AI processing framework that transforms raw medical text into structured clinical data following O3's two-axis model. This framework determines how every medical fact is classified, extracted, and stored in Guardian's database foundation.

Unlike simple text extraction, clinical classification applies healthcare-specific intelligence to understand medical concepts, relationships, and contexts, ensuring that extracted data supports clinical decision-making and healthcare standards compliance.

## Clinical Classification Framework Map

### 1. Activity Types Classification
**File:** [activity-types.md](./activity-types.md)  
**Database Field:** `patient_clinical_events.activity_type`  
**Framework:** O3's Primary Classification Axis

**Classification Logic:**
- **observation**: Information gathering without changing patient state
- **intervention**: Actions that change or intend to change patient state

**Why Critical:** Every medical fact must be classified as either observation or intervention to populate the core `patient_clinical_events` table correctly.

### 2. Clinical Purposes Classification  
**File:** [clinical-purposes.md](./clinical-purposes.md)  
**Database Field:** `patient_clinical_events.clinical_purposes[]`  
**Framework:** O3's Secondary Classification Axis

**Classification Categories:**
- **screening**: Asymptomatic disease detection
- **diagnostic**: Symptom cause determination
- **therapeutic**: Treatment delivery
- **monitoring**: Condition tracking over time  
- **preventive**: Disease prevention

**Why Critical:** Clinical purposes enable advanced healthcare analytics and clinical decision support by understanding the intent behind each medical activity.

### 3. Medical Event Extraction
**File:** [event-extraction.md](./event-extraction.md)  
**Database Fields:** `event_name`, `method`, `body_site`, healthcare codes  
**Framework:** Clinical concept normalization and enrichment

**Extraction Components:**
- Event name standardization and medical concept identification
- Method extraction (laboratory, imaging, injection, physical_exam)
- Anatomical site identification (left_ear, chest, right_hand)
- Healthcare standards integration (SNOMED-CT, LOINC, CPT codes)

**Why Critical:** Provides the detailed clinical context and standard codes that enable healthcare interoperability and clinical analytics.

### 4. Smart Feature Detection
**File:** [smart-feature-detection.md](./smart-feature-detection.md)  
**Database Table:** `smart_health_features`  
**Framework:** Context-sensitive healthcare feature activation

**Feature Detection Types:**
- **pregnancy**: Pregnancy care and prenatal features
- **pediatric**: Child health tracking and pediatric resources  
- **veterinary**: Pet care features and veterinary provider integration
- **chronic_disease**: Disease management tools and monitoring
- **family_planning**: Reproductive health and fertility features

**Why Critical:** Enables context-sensitive UI that adapts to specific healthcare needs and life circumstances.

## O3 Clinical Classification Model

### Two-Axis Framework Overview
```yaml
o3_classification_model:
  primary_axis:
    name: "activity_type"
    purpose: "Categorize the fundamental nature of the medical activity"
    values: ["observation", "intervention"]
    
  secondary_axis: 
    name: "clinical_purposes"
    purpose: "Identify the healthcare intent behind the activity"
    values: ["screening", "diagnostic", "therapeutic", "monitoring", "preventive"]
    cardinality: "multiple" # Can have multiple purposes
```

### Classification Decision Matrix
```yaml
classification_examples:
  "Blood pressure measurement during annual physical":
    activity_type: "observation"  # Gathering information
    clinical_purposes: ["screening", "monitoring"]  # Multiple purposes
    
  "Influenza vaccination administration":
    activity_type: "intervention"  # Taking action
    clinical_purposes: ["preventive"]  # Disease prevention
    
  "Hemoglobin test for suspected anemia":
    activity_type: "observation"  # Lab test gathering info
    clinical_purposes: ["diagnostic"]  # Investigating symptoms
    
  "Blood pressure medication prescription":
    activity_type: "intervention"  # Prescribing treatment
    clinical_purposes: ["therapeutic", "monitoring"]  # Treatment and tracking
```

### Classification Confidence Requirements
```yaml
confidence_thresholds:
  activity_type:
    minimum: 0.80  # High confidence required for primary axis
    target: 0.90   # Target confidence for automatic processing
    
  clinical_purposes:
    minimum: 0.70  # Moderate confidence for secondary axis  
    target: 0.85   # Target for high-quality classification
    
  event_extraction:
    event_name: 0.75      # Event identification confidence
    method: 0.65          # Method extraction confidence
    body_site: 0.60       # Anatomical site confidence
    healthcare_codes: 0.80 # Standards compliance confidence
```

## Database Integration Architecture

### Core Clinical Tables Population
Each classification component directly populates specific database fields:

```yaml
patient_clinical_events:
  populated_by: "All clinical classification components"  
  key_fields:
    activity_type: "activity-types.md classification"
    clinical_purposes: "clinical-purposes.md classification"

    body_site: "event-extraction.md anatomical extraction"
    snomed_code: "event-extraction.md healthcare standards"
    loinc_code: "event-extraction.md healthcare standards"  
    cpt_code: "event-extraction.md healthcare standards"

patient_observations:
  populated_by: "event-extraction.md + observation-specific processing"
  condition: "activity_type = 'observation'"
  key_fields: "observation_type, value_numeric, unit, interpretation"

patient_interventions:
  populated_by: "event-extraction.md + intervention-specific processing"  
  condition: "activity_type = 'intervention'"
  key_fields: "intervention_type, substance_name, dose_amount, route"

smart_health_features:
  populated_by: "smart-feature-detection.md context analysis"
  key_fields: "feature_type, activation_source, detection_confidence"
```

    if not classification_result.clinical_purposes:
        validation_errors.append("clinical_purposes cannot be empty")
        
    # Value validation
    valid_activity_types = ['observation', 'intervention']
    if classification_result.activity_type not in valid_activity_types:
        validation_errors.append(f"Invalid activity_type: {classification_result.activity_type}")
        
    valid_purposes = ['screening', 'diagnostic', 'therapeutic', 'monitoring', 'preventive']
    for purpose in classification_result.clinical_purposes:
        if purpose not in valid_purposes:
            validation_errors.append(f"Invalid clinical purpose: {purpose}")
    
    # Confidence validation
    if classification_result.activity_confidence < 0.8:
        validation_errors.append("Activity type confidence below minimum threshold")
        
    # Logical consistency validation
    if (classification_result.activity_type == 'intervention' and 
        'screening' in classification_result.clinical_purposes):
        validation_errors.append("Interventions should not be classified as screening")
    
    return {
        'is_valid': len(validation_errors) == 0,
        'errors': validation_errors
