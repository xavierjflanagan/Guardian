# Current Status: AI Processing Gap Analysis

**Date:** August 19, 2025  
**Status:** Critical gaps identified between current implementation and database foundation requirements

---

## Executive Summary

The current AI processing implementation extracts basic medical information but **cannot populate the database foundation tables** that have been carefully designed. This document maps each gap to specific database tables and fields that cannot be populated with the current extraction approach.

---

## Critical Gaps by Database Table

### 1. `user_profiles` Table - Multi-Profile Support

**Current State:**
- Single-user processing only
- No profile type detection
- No relationship tracking

**Required State:**
- Classify documents to profile_type: `self`, `child`, `adult_dependent`, `pet`
- Detect relationships and legal_status
- Support pregnancy profiles and transitions

**Blocked Database Fields:**
```sql
profile_type         -- Cannot determine self/child/adult_dependent/pet
relationship         -- Cannot extract relationship to account owner
auth_level          -- Cannot perform progressive authentication
is_pregnancy_profile -- Cannot detect pregnancy contexts
```

---

### 2. `patient_clinical_events` Table - O3's Clinical Classification

**Current State:**
```json
{
  "medicalData": {
    "immunisations": ["Flu vaccine"],
    "conditions": ["Hypertension"]
  }
}
```

**Required State:**
```json
{
  "clinicalEvents": [{
    "activity_type": "intervention",
    "clinical_purposes": ["preventive"],
    "event_name": "Influenza Vaccination",
    "method": "injection",
    "snomed_code": "86198006"
  }]
}
```

**Blocked Database Fields:**
```sql
activity_type       -- No observation vs intervention classification
clinical_purposes[] -- No multi-purpose classification
event_name         -- Generic names instead of specific events
method             -- No extraction of how procedure was done
body_site          -- No body location extraction
snomed_code        -- No SNOMED-CT integration
loinc_code         -- No LOINC integration
cpt_code           -- No CPT integration
```

---

### 3. `clinical_fact_sources` Table - Spatial Provenance

**Current State:**
- No spatial coordinate extraction
- No page number tracking
- No bounding box data

**Required State:**
- PostGIS GEOMETRY(POLYGON, 4326) for each fact
- Page numbers and coordinates for click-to-zoom
- Text alignment between AI facts and OCR regions

**Blocked Database Fields:**
```sql
page_number        -- No page tracking
bounding_box       -- No PostGIS spatial data
source_text        -- No original text preservation
extraction_method  -- No method tracking
confidence_score   -- Basic confidence only
```

### 4. `healthcare_timeline_events` Table - Timeline Metadata

**Current State:**
- No timeline metadata generation
- No display categorization
- No searchable content

**Required State:**
- Generate display_category, display_subcategory
- Create titles and summaries for UI
- Build searchable content for chatbot

**Blocked Database Fields:**
```sql
display_category     -- No categorization (visit/test_result/treatment)
display_subcategory  -- No subcategorization
title               -- No user-friendly titles
summary             -- No event summaries
icon                -- No UI icon selection
searchable_content  -- No content for natural language queries
event_tags[]        -- No tagging system
```

---

### 5. `smart_health_features` Table - Feature Activation

**Current State:**
- No content-based feature detection
- No pregnancy detection
- No pediatric/adult care differentiation

**Required State:**
- Detect pregnancy contexts → activate pregnancy tab
- Detect fertility data → activate family planning
- Detect pediatric content → activate child features

**Blocked Database Fields:**
```sql
feature_type        -- No detection of feature triggers
activation_reason   -- No tracking of why feature activated
detection_metadata  -- No metadata about detection
```

---

### 6. `ai_processing_sessions` Table - Compliance Tracking

**Current State:**
```json
{
  "confidence": {"overall": 0.95}
}
```

**Required State:**
```json
{
  "processing_pipeline": {
    "ocr": {"service": "google_vision", "version": "v1"},
    "llm": {"service": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o-mini"}
  },
  "api_costs_usd": 1.00,
  "quality_metrics": {
    "total_facts_extracted": 15,
    "facts_with_clinical_codes": 12
  }
}
```

**Blocked Database Fields:**
```sql
processing_pipeline  -- No pipeline tracking
api_costs_usd       -- No cost attribution
processing_duration_ms -- No performance tracking
quality_metrics     -- No quality measurement
```

## Impact Analysis

### What Works Today
✅ Basic document upload and storage  
✅ Simple medical data extraction  
✅ Basic confidence scoring  

### What's Completely Blocked
❌ **Multi-profile family management** - Cannot assign documents to correct profiles  
❌ **Clinical event normalization** - Cannot populate clinical tables correctly  
❌ **Healthcare standards** - No SNOMED-CT/LOINC/CPT codes  
❌ **Timeline generation** - Cannot create patient journey  
❌ **Spatial provenance** - No click-to-zoom functionality  
❌ **Smart features** - No adaptive UI based on content  
❌ **Compliance tracking** - Incomplete audit trails

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk - Data Integrity
Without proper profile classification, medical data could be assigned to the wrong family member, creating serious safety risks.

### High Risk - Clinical Accuracy  
Without O3's classification model, clinical events are stored as unstructured text rather than normalized data, preventing clinical decision support.

### Medium Risk - Compliance
Without complete session tracking and provenance, the system cannot meet healthcare compliance requirements.

### Medium Risk - User Experience
Without timeline metadata and smart features, users cannot experience the intuitive healthcare journey visualization.

---

## Path Forward

### Immediate Priority (Phase 1)
1. Implement multi-profile classification
2. Build O3's two-axis classification
3. Integrate healthcare standards APIs

### Next Priority (Phase 2)
1. Generate timeline metadata
2. Detect smart features
3. Build normalization pipeline

### Future Enhancement (Phase 2+)
1. Add spatial precision with OCR
2. Implement text alignment algorithms
3. Create PostGIS spatial indices

---

## Success Criteria

The AI processing pipeline will be considered complete when it can:

1. **Classify documents** to the correct profile with >95% accuracy
2. **Extract clinical events** using O3's two-axis model
3. **Assign clinical codes** from SNOMED-CT/LOINC/CPT
4. **Generate timeline metadata** for every clinical fact
5. **Track spatial coordinates** for document regions (Phase 2+)
6. **Detect smart features** from content analysis
7. **Maintain compliance** with full session tracking

*This gap analysis clearly shows that the current MVP implementation cannot support Guardian's database foundation. The path forward requires a complete redesign of the AI processing pipeline to generate the rich, normalized data structure required by the clinical tables.*
