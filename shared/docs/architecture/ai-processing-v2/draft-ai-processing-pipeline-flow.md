# Guardian AI Processing Pipeline Flow

**Complete end-to-end flow from uploaded document to user dashboard**

---
File upload:
  - Raw file uploaded/ingested

File pre-processing:
  - File Security scanning
  - Raw File Duplicate detection 
        > > SHA-256 hash checking should happen immediately after security scanning. It's cheap (<1ms) and can save 100% of processing costs for duplicates. Raw file hashing is more reliable than post-OCR content comparison.
  - File formatting optimization engine 
      - Format detection and intelligent document routing:
        - Fast path: acceptable formats pass straight through to next stage
        - Slow path: non-acceptable formats pass through rendering step, converted into acceptable formats in preparation for next stage.
        - Hybrid processing, combination approach for mixed-content files 
            > > Mixed content is common (~15-20% of uploads). Example: PDF with pages 1-2 as native text, pages 3-4 as scanned images. SMART APPROACH: Process page-by-page, not whole-file. Each page gets optimal processing path.
  - File enhancement engine
      - Quality assessment, Image enhancement, Multi-page handling
  - Document Storage
      - storage of both raw file +/- rendered new version if required. 
      > Store 3 versions: 1) Original raw file (always), 2) Enhanced/optimized version (if processing occurred), 3) Individual page extracts (for mixed content). Fast path files still get basic enhancement (orientation, brightness).

File Analysis and information extraction:
  - OCR engine: 
      - Input is faw file post pre-processing stage
      - Output is structured text with spatial coordinates.
      > OCR output includes raw text + bounding boxes + confidence scores. Not just plain text.
  - Multi-step AI engine: 
      - Input is a combnination of raw file iput + ocr output, depending on the AI engine.
      - Output is structured JSON
      - AI engine 1 (Authentication/validation engine):
        - Input: hopefully only needs to be OCR text to make it cheaper and quicker
        - Roles: 
          - Profile matching check
          - Healthcare Relevance Check
      - AI engine 2 (but maybe split up into engine 2 + engine 3 or more)
        - This is where the actual health data file is finally analyzed by ai with meaningful info extracted 
        - All health-related information, including health adjacent info, should be extracted from the file. Ideally this happens all in one AI call but maybe it will have to be split up into a few seperate rolling AI calls 
        - In my mind, i envisaged that the AI would go through the file (for simplicity for now lets say its 1 page) and for each piece of information which I will call an 'entity' (whether it be a piece of text, a logo, a name, a signiture, a graph, a table, a medication list etc etc) the AI engine runs through a deterministic pre-planned deicsion tree (planned by me) to decide what to do with that entity. 
        - Extracted Entity decision tree:
          - Is the entity a clinical event or is it a non-clinical event entity? 
              - i.e does the entity have clinical signficiance and relevance and does it add to the users health knoledgebase. And without this entity, would there be a hole in the users healthcare journey? Not sure how to word this but hopefully you get the point.
              > my thoughts here are that sometimes things would be included on an uploaded file that are not clinical event entities such as billing info, or patients home address, or a doctors signature or doctors logo etc. and have no significance for the user's healthcare jounrey and will provide no meaningul addition to the users healthcare knowledgebase. So my thoughts here are that the AI should be provided with a simple decision tree right at the beginning asking it whether the extracted entity that is currently extracting has any clinical relevance and significance and meaningulc ontribution etc - if it doesnt, then the entity should still be logged but doesnt need to progress any further in AI analysis. 
          - Then, after the entity is deemed 'health-significant' to the user, it enters the next part of the decision tree, which is maybe a categorization step that maybe might be the obervation vs intervention classification stage. However, i think there are health entities (pieces of extracted health info from the uploaded file) that wont fit either of these such as provider info, identifying info, appointment info etc. I dont know what to call this category, but maybe something like 'heathcare adjacent' data or 'identifier' data, or actually maybe having both of those two would be a good idea. 
          - i think there also needs to be a stage for where the AI takes a step back and extract summarizing and non-speific data such as the title of the file (there will be the raw title as per the upload, but then there might be a title at the top of the uploaded page, but also an ai generated summary title for the page and or file of pages would be a good idea), the date the page was created/signed and all other identifier information about the file that can only be extracted from the content of the file, but then also identifier information about the user and the provider within the content of the file (such as the patient identifier personal info, and then the doctor's identifier information). A file may also have appointment information mentioned (past or future) which is neither obeservation or intervention data could be categorized as health-adjacent data (or maybe health jounrey data is a good name). 
              > for AI, is it better to have a step by step deicsion tree of multiple binary options to select from (option A), or is it better to just list out all classificiation categories for the AI to chose from in one single decision (option B), i guess option B means less AI compute and maybe faster time to complete outcome?? so maybe option B is better...? But with option B you dont get labelling asigned for every step of the decision tree like you do in option A which could be very useful for posterotiy, auditing, summarzing etc (more data the better), but maybe option B could do that..?
                  > Answer: YES, Option B (single multi-class decision) is better for AI models. They handle multiple categories better than sequential binary decisions. You still get full audit trail in the output JSON. Step-by-step binary decisions would require multiple AI calls which defeats your optimization goal.
                    > **Multi-Level Labeling**: Yes, the AI will perform hierarchical labeling like: 
                    > ```json
                    > {
                    >   "entity_type": "clinical_event",
                    >   "activity_type": "observation", 
                    >   "observation_subtype": "vital_sign",
                    >   "vital_type": "blood_pressure",
                    >   "measurement_type": "systolic"
                    > }
                    > ```
                    > This gives you the granular audit trail you want while keeping it in a single AI decision.
                  - Entity Categories Beyond Observation/Intervention:**
                      > You're absolutely right. Suggest these categories:
                      > - **Clinical Events**: Observations & Interventions (goes to clinical tables)
                      > - **Healthcare Identifiers**: Patient info, provider info, facility info 
                      > - **Healthcare Journey**: Appointments, referrals, care plans
                      > - **Administrative**: Billing, insurance, legal signatures
                      > - **Non-Clinical**: Logos, headers, formatting elements
        - the info that will be most complex and compute intensive for ai to analyse will be anything that has been deemed obserbation or intervention as i think these will be more data rich and need to be organized into a very structured format in prep for normalziation stage into the database tables. At this point i guess we can either give the AI all strcuture formats for every type of observation and intervetion data type and then get it to just follow the schema that corresponds to the data entity it has (option A), or we could get the AI to call in and pull the correct schema depending on what tupe of obeservation or intervention entity it has (option B) (*not sure how this would work but maybe through MCPs). The reason for why i have thought up option B is that i dont know whether option A would overhwelm the AI model with the volume of schemas that may exist (they do already exist and can be found in database-foundation, as well as other places in our codebase)...? Option B does sound quite clean and nice just saying...but no idea if it would actually work. 
        - because the AI will be doing this decision tree style data extracting, transofrmation, labelling etc, for multiple entities per page, it would make sense that it is kind of happening all at once inside the same single AI call, with the schemas cached into memory and available to the ai from the get go to reference and to seek direction from. So maybe MCPs dont really have a place in this project design. 
            > **CORRECTED RECOMMENDATION**: Two-call architecture is the RIGHT approach. The AI should first identify entity types and required schemas, then fetch specific schemas dynamically for detailed extraction. This keeps prompts focused and manageable while optimizing costs.
            > **UPDATED APPROACH**: Two-call architecture provides better cost efficiency and context management. First call identifies entities and schema requirements, second call performs detailed extraction with targeted schemas.


## SCHEMA RESEARCH PRIORITY
**CRITICAL NEXT STEP**: Complete database schema analysis before +finalizing AI processing pipeline.
**Current Gap**: Two-call architecture requires precise understanding of:
  - Guardian's clinical table structures (`patient_observations`, + `patient_interventions`, etc.)
  - Required vs optional fields for each table
  - Exact data types, constraints, and relationships
  - Minimum viable schema guides for AI extraction
**Action Required**: Research + `shared/docs/architecture/database-foundation-v2/` to map exact schema requirements, then work backwards to optimize AI processing approach. Consider unified generalized schema vs table-specific approach.
**Status**: Pipeline architecture parked pending schema research completion.
