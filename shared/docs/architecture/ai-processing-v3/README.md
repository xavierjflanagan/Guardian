# AI Processing v3: Semantic Document Architecture with Hybrid Clinical Narratives

**Status:** Architecture Complete - Ready for Implementation  
**Date:** 27 August 2025  
**Updated:** 27 August 2025 - Semantic Document Architecture Integration  
**Purpose:** Semantic shell file + clinical narratives architecture with three-pass AI processing  
**Previous:** Built comprehensive pipeline architecture in [ai-processing-v2](../ai-processing-v2/)

---

## Overview
AI Processing v3 implements a revolutionary **semantic document architecture** with hybrid shell file + clinical narratives approach. This system solves the critical multi-document problem while providing both document-centric and story-centric views of medical data, ensuring clinical safety and user choice.

**Key Breakthrough:** Semantic segmentation of complex medical documents into clinically coherent narratives while maintaining reliable shell file fallback system.

## Architecture Decisions

### Confirmed Decisions
1. **Three-Pass AI Architecture** - Pass 1 entity detection, Pass 2 clinical enrichment, Pass 3 semantic narratives
2. **Hybrid Document System** - Shell files (physical) + clinical narratives (semantic) dual architecture
3. **Progressive Enhancement** - System functional after Pass 2, enhanced after Pass 3
4. **Dual-Lens User Experience** - Document view + narrative view with user choice
5. **Clinical Safety Priority** - Prevents dangerous multi-document context mixing
6. **Graceful Degradation** - Shell file fallback ensures system always functional
7. **Russian Babushka Doll Context** - Multi-layered clinical context from timeline to specialized tables

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Hybrid Migration Approach** - Replace primitive document intelligence with semantic architecture
2. **System Resilience** - No single point of failure, always maintains core functionality
3. **User Choice Preservation** - Both document-minded and clinical-minded user preferences supported
4. **Future Scalability** - Foundation for patient-scoped clinical journeys across documents

## Semantic Architecture Overview

**Shell Files (Physical Layer):**
- Actual uploaded documents with metadata
- AI synthesized summaries of all contained narratives
- Always reliable reference point for clinical data

**Clinical Narratives (Semantic Layer):**
- AI-determined medical storylines based on clinical meaning
- Can span non-contiguous pages within documents
- Clinically coherent summaries (e.g., "Hypertension Management Journey")
- Optional enhancement - system works without them

**Processing Flow:**
```
Pass 1: Shell file â†’ Entity detection with location data
Pass 2: Entities â†’ Clinical events â†’ Database (fully functional)
Pass 3: Clinical events â†’ Semantic narratives (enhancement layer)
```

## Next Immediate Action

**Complete implementation execution plan is available in [09-semantic-migration-execution-plan.md](09-semantic-migration-execution-plan.md)**

**START HERE:** Begin with semantic migration to replace primitive document intelligence:
1. **Week 1:** Remove primitive document intelligence + implement shell files + clinical narratives schema
2. **Week 2:** Implement Pass 3 semantic narrative creator and dual-lens view service  
3. **Week 3:** Dashboard dual-view interface with user preference system
4. **Week 4:** Clinical safety validation and production readiness

## Key Documents
