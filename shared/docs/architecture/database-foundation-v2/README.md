## Overview

The Database Foundation v2 provides the same robust clinical data architecture as v7.2 with dramatically improved navigation and consumer guidance. This is the secure storage and normalization layer that AI processing components must populate and frontend applications consume.

**Key Improvements in v7:**
- 🏗️ **Modular Architecture**: Split into focused, maintainable modules
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Multi-Profile Support**: Complete family healthcare management with dependent profiles (children, pets)
- 🕒 **Healthcare Journey**: Comprehensive patient timeline and healthcare story logging across all profiles
- 🤱 **Smart Health Features**: Auto-activating family planning, pregnancy, and specialized care panels
- 🏥 **Healthcare Standards**: FHIR/HL7 integration for interoperability
- 👤 **User-Centric**: Enhanced consent management, progressive authentication, and personalization
- 🚀 **Performance**: Advanced queuing and real-time capabilities
- 🔒 **Security**: Profile-aware RLS policies with contamination prevention and audit improvements

## Architecture Principles

### 1. **Modular Design**
Each module is self-contained with clear interfaces and dependencies, enabling parallel development and maintenance.

### 2. **Healthcare-First**
Built with FHIR standards and healthcare compliance requirements as first-class citizens, not afterthoughts.

### 3. **Family-Centric Ownership**  
Primary account holders have granular control over their own data and dependent profiles (children, pets) with comprehensive consent management, progressive authentication, and audit trails. Architecture designed for complex family healthcare scenarios while maintaining data sovereignty.

### 4. **Performance by Design**
Optimized for healthcare data patterns with appropriate indexing, partitioning, and caching strategies.

### 5. **Security & Privacy**
Multi-layered security with profile-aware RLS policies, AI-powered contamination prevention, field-level encryption options, and comprehensive audit logging across all family profiles.

## Getting Started
1. **Review Core Schema** - Start with the foundational database design and multi-profile architecture
2. **Understand Multi-Profile System** - Review family healthcare management, progressive authentication, and profile switching
3. **Understand Security Model** - Review profile-aware RLS policies and contamination prevention  
4. **Plan Implementation** - Follow the implementation guide for fresh deployment with integrated multi-profile support
5. **Deploy Features** - Use the roadmap for phased rollout of family healthcare coordination features

## Migration from v7.2

The database-foundation-v2 is a documentation reorganization with improved consumer navigation - **no schema changes required**. All existing SQL files and implementations remain valid.

**Changes:**
- ✅ Enhanced navigation for AI processing, frontend, and provider portal consumers
- ✅ Consumer-focused documentation structure with specific integration guides
- ✅ Bridge documentation references for AI processing integration
- ✅ Quick-start sections and cross-references for faster onboarding

**No Changes:**
- 🔄 Database schema (remains compatible with existing v7.2)
- 🔄 SQL implementation files (no modifications to deployment scripts)
- 🔄 API endpoints (existing integrations unaffected)

## Design Evolution
- **v2.0** (2025-08-19): Enhanced navigation and consumer guidance for AI processing integration
- **v7.2** (2025-08-06): Production-ready modular architecture with integrated multi-profile support, family healthcare coordination, smart health features, and FHIR integration
- **v7.3 (Planned)**: Provider portal integration with universal provider registry, family access control, and cross-profile healthcare coordination
