# Guardian Database Foundation v7.2

**Status:** ‚úÖ Production Ready  
**Date:** August 06 2025  
**Version:** 7.2  

---

## Overview

The Database Foundation is the secure storage and normalization layer of the Guardian pipeline. This module handles clinical data storage, multi-profile management, security compliance, and healthcare journey management after AI processing has extracted structured medical information.

**Key Improvements in v7:**
- üèóÔ∏è **Modular Architecture**: Split into focused, maintainable modules
- üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ **Multi-Profile Support**: Complete family healthcare management with dependent profiles (children, pets)
- üïí **Healthcare Journey**: Comprehensive patient timeline and healthcare story logging across all profiles
- ü§± **Smart Health Features**: Auto-activating family planning, pregnancy, and specialized care panels
- üè• **Healthcare Standards**: FHIR/HL7 integration for interoperability
- üë§ **User-Centric**: Enhanced consent management, progressive authentication, and personalization
- üöÄ **Performance**: Advanced queuing and real-time capabilities
- üîí **Security**: Profile-aware RLS policies with contamination prevention and audit improvements

## Architecture Principles

### 1. **Modular Design**
Each module is self-contained with clear interfaces and dependencies, enabling parallel development and maintenance.

### 2. **Healthcare-First**
Built with FHIR standards and healthcare compliance requirements as first-class citizens, not afterthoughts.

### 3. **Family-Centric Ownership**  
Primary account holders have granular control over their own data and dependent profiles (children, pets) with comprehensive consent management, progressive authentication, and audit trails. Architecture designed for complex family healthcare scenarios while maintaining data sovereignty.

### 4. **Performance by Design**
Optimized for healthcare data patterns with appropriate indexing, partitioning, and caching strategies.

### 5. **Security & Privacy**
Multi-layered security with profile-aware RLS policies, AI-powered contamination prevention, field-level encryption options, and comprehensive audit logging across all family profiles.

## Getting Started
1. **Review Core Schema** - Start with the foundational database design and multi-profile architecture
2. **Understand Multi-Profile System** - Review family healthcare management, progressive authentication, and profile switching
3. **Understand Security Model** - Review profile-aware RLS policies and contamination prevention  
4. **Plan Implementation** - Follow the implementation guide for fresh deployment with integrated multi-profile support
5. **Deploy Features** - Use the roadmap for phased rollout of family healthcare coordination features

## Design Evolution
- **v7.0** (2025-07-31): Production-ready modular architecture with integrated multi-profile support, family healthcare coordination, smart health features, and FHIR integration
- **v7.3 (Planned)**: Provider portal integration with universal provider registry, family access control, and cross-profile healthcare coordination
- **v6.0-v1.0** (2025-07-26 to 2025-07-28): Design and planning phases (archived)

## Contributing

When contributing to v7 modules:

1. **Single Responsibility** - Each module should have a clear, focused purpose
2. **Clear Dependencies** - Document any cross-module dependencies
3. **Fresh Implementation** - Design for ground-up deployment with multi-profile support integrated from day one
4. **Testing** - Add appropriate test scenarios for new features
5. **Documentation** - Update both technical and user-facing documentation
