## Critical Finding: Healthcare Context Bifurcation

### Pattern 1: High Healthcare Context (Runs 1 & 2)
**20 healthcare_context entities per run**

**Breakdown:**
- Run 1: 8 patient_identifier + 8 healthcare_context_other + 4 facility_identifier = 20
- Run 2: 8 patient_identifier + 11 healthcare_context_other + 1 facility_identifier = 20

**Interpretation:** AI splitting patient demographics into granular entities
- Separate entities for labels and values (e.g., "Name:" + "Xavier Flanagan")
- Individual address components split
- Each phone number as separate entity

### Pattern 2: Low Healthcare Context (Runs 4 & 5)
**9 healthcare_context entities per run**

**Breakdown:**
- Run 4: 8 patient_identifier + 1 provider_identifier = 9
- Run 5: 8 patient_identifier + 1 facility_identifier = 9

**Interpretation:** AI consolidating patient demographics into combined entities
- Labels + values merged (e.g., "Name: Xavier Flanagan")
- Address lines consolidated
- Contact information grouped

**Impact:**
- **Zero data loss** - All information captured in both patterns
- **Different granularity** - Same content, different entity boundaries
- **Consistent within pattern** - Runs 1&2 identical, Runs 4&5 identical

|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| **Cost per Document** | $0.220 | $0.209 | $0.184 | $0.198 | **$0.203** |
| **Processing Time** | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | ~4 minutes |
| **Model** | gpt-5-mini | gpt-5-mini | gpt-5-mini | gpt-5-mini | - |

**Cost Variance:** 16% range ($0.184-$0.220)
- Likely correlated with entity count
- Run 1 (47 entities) was most expensive
- Run 4 (35 entities) was least expensive

---

## Sources of Variability (Ranked by Impact)

### 1. Healthcare Context Consolidation (HIGH IMPACT - 55% variance)
**Pattern:** Bifurcation between granular (20 entities) and consolidated (9 entities)

**Hypothesis:** The AI makes a high-level decision early in processing:
- "Split all labels from values" → 20 entities (Runs 1&2)
- "Combine labels with values" → 9 entities (Runs 4&5)

**Evidence:**
- Perfect consistency WITHIN each pattern (Runs 1&2 identical, Runs 4&5 identical)
- No gradient (no runs with 10-19 entities) - it's binary
- Same 8 patient_identifier entities across ALL runs (core data unchanged)

**Impact:**
- ✅ Zero data loss - all information captured
- ⚠️ Entity count unreliable as quality metric
- ⚠️ Pass 2 parsing must handle both patterns

### 2. Immunization Splitting (MEDIUM IMPACT - 33% variance)
**Pattern:** Multi-component vaccines handled differently

**Runs with 15 immunizations (Runs 1&5):**
- Combination vaccines split into individual components
- "Boostrix" → 3 entities (Pertussis, Diphtheria, Tetanus)
- "Vivaxim" → 2 entities (Hepatitis A, Typhoid)

**Runs with 10 immunizations (Runs 2&4):**
- Combination vaccines kept together
- "Boostrix (Pertussis, Diphtheria, Tetanus)" → 1 entity
- "Vivaxim (Hepatitis A, Typhoid)" → 1 entity

**Impact:**
- ✅ All vaccine components captured either way
- ✅ Clinical data complete
- ⚠️ Different entity counts but same medical information

### 3. Document Structure Classification (LOW IMPACT - 30% variance)
**Pattern:** Form elements classified differently

**Runs 1&2:** Use `document_structure_other` (7 and 4 entities)
**Runs 4&5:** Use `form_structure` (6 and 5 entities)

**Impact:**
- ✅ All document structure elements detected
- ✅ No impact on clinical processing (document_structure is logging-only)
- ℹ️ Shows AI learning/adapting taxonomy usage

## Comparison to Test 03 (Minimal Prompt)

| Metric | Test 03 (Minimal) | Test 05 (Gold Standard) | Winner |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|--------|
| **Entity Count** | 52-55 (avg 53) | 35-47 (avg 40) | Test 03 (+32%) |
| **Confidence** | 50% (fallback) | 97% (real AI) | ✅ **Test 05** |
| **OCR Agreement** | 0% (not tracked) | 97% | ✅ **Test 05** |
| **Taxonomy Classification** | 2 types only | 10+ types | ✅ **Test 05** |
| **Metadata Quality** | "minimal test", "unknown" | Rich descriptions | ✅ **Test 05** |
| **Cost** | $0.09-0.11 | $0.18-0.22 | Test 03 (51% cheaper) |
| **Production Ready** | ❌ Poor metadata | ✅ High quality | ✅ **Test 05** |

**Verdict:** Test 05 wins on quality, Test 03 wins on cost. For medical data, **quality > quantity**.

---

## Production Implications

### Entity Count is NOT a Reliable Quality Metric

**Evidence:**
- 25% variance across identical document uploads (35-47 entities)
- Same clinical data captured in all runs
- Variance driven by entity boundary decisions, not data detection

**Recommendation:** Monitor quality metrics instead:
- ✅ OCR agreement score (target: >95%) - ACHIEVED (97%)
- ✅ Confidence scores (target: >90%) - ACHIEVED (97%)
- ✅ Manual review queue (target: 0) - ACHIEVED (0)
- ❌ Entity count (unreliable, do not use)

### Pass 2 Must Handle Variable Entity Granularity

**Scenario 1: Granular entities (Runs 1&2)**
```
Entity 1: "Name:"
Entity 2: "Xavier Flanagan"
→ Pass 2 must parse both to extract patient name
```

**Scenario 2: Consolidated entities (Runs 4&5)**
```
Entity 1: "Name: Xavier Flanagan"
→ Pass 2 must parse single entity to extract patient name
```

**Solution:** Pass 2 entity parsing must use NLP to extract structured data from variable text, not rely on 1 entity = 1 field assumptions.

### Cost Budget

**Observed range:** $0.184 - $0.220 per document
**Average:** $0.203 per document
**Recommendation:** Budget $0.25/document for safety margin

**At scale:**
- 1,000 docs/month: $250/month
- 10,000 docs/month: $2,500/month
- 100,000 docs/month: $25,000/month

**Still 60% cheaper than GPT-4o alternative (~$0.50/document).**
