## Test Execution Pattern (Reference from Pass 1)

Each test should follow this structure:

1. **Test Setup**
   - Document selection criteria
   - Expected outcomes
   - Success criteria

2. **Test Execution**
   - Processing steps
   - Data collection methodology
   - Measurements taken

3. **Results**
   - Quantitative metrics
   - Qualitative observations
   - Database query results

4. **Analysis**
   - Findings interpretation
   - Issues discovered
   - Recommendations

5. **Action Items**
   - Required fixes
   - Configuration changes
   - Follow-up tests

## Success Criteria (From Planning)

**Extraction Quality:**
- Extraction Completeness: >95% of clinical entities successfully extracted
- Database Write Success: >99% successful writes to V3 tables
- Referential Integrity: 100% (hub-and-spoke FK constraints enforced)

**Performance:**
- Processing Time: 3-5 seconds per document
- Cost per Document: $0.003-0.006 (GPT-5-mini)
- Token Efficiency: 70% reduction vs single comprehensive AI call

**Medical Coding:**
- Code Assignment Rate: >80% auto-accepted (confidence >= 0.80)
- Manual Review Rate: 10-20% (confidence 0.60-0.79)
- Fallback Rate: <10% (confidence < 0.60)

---

## Test Data Sources

**Documents for Testing:**
- Simple documents (1-3 clinical events) - Test detailed schema performance
- Complex documents (10+ clinical events) - Test minimal schema performance
- Multi-encounter documents - Test encounter extraction accuracy
- Known medical codes - Test Pass 1.5 code matching accuracy

**Validation References:**
- Pass 1 entity detection results (entity_processing_audit)
- Manual clinical review (healthcare professional validation)
- Standard medical code databases (LOINC, SNOMED, RxNorm, PBS)
