# Pass 1.5 Investigation Archive

**Date Archived:** 2025-10-19
**Reason:** Files consolidated into single authoritative document

## Archived Files

### CRITICAL_VECTOR_SEARCH_FAILURE_ANALYSIS_2025-10-19.md
- **Original Created:** 2025-10-19 (morning)
- **Purpose:** Initial investigation into vector search failures
- **Key Content:** 5-phase solution strategy, 2nd AI bot review, detailed implementation plans
- **Status at Archive:** "ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED - SOLUTION DESIGN IN PROGRESS"
- **Why Archived:** Superseded by consolidated document with complete investigation results

### PASS15_RPC_INVESTIGATION_FINDINGS_2025-10-19.md
- **Original Created:** 2025-10-19 (evening)
- **Purpose:** RPC function validation and truth test results
- **Key Content:** Real Pass 1 entity tests, truth test methodology, intern validation
- **Status at Archive:** "ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED - Analysis Complete (No Changes Made)"
- **Why Archived:** Superseded by consolidated document with complete investigation results

## Current Authoritative Document

**Use this document instead:**
```
PASS15_ROOT_CAUSE_AND_SOLUTION_PLAN.md
```

This consolidated document contains:
- Complete investigation timeline (morning → evening)
- All test results (real Pass 1 entities, truth test, coverage verification)
- Root cause analysis (embedding input mismatch)
- Complete 5-phase solution strategy
- 2nd AI bot peer review
- Actionable next steps

## What Changed

### Consolidation Benefits:
1. **Single source of truth** - No conflicting information between multiple docs
2. **Complete timeline** - Shows progression from initial hypothesis to confirmed root cause
3. **All evidence in one place** - Test results, truth test, text comparisons
4. **Clear path forward** - Phase 1-5 implementation plan with decision gates

### Information Preserved:
- ✅ All test results and metrics
- ✅ 5-phase solution strategy (unchanged)
- ✅ 2nd AI bot peer review (complete)
- ✅ Truth test methodology and results
- ✅ Real Pass 1 entity test data
- ✅ Acknowledgments (user, intern, 2nd AI bot)

### Information Removed:
- ❌ Duplicate "Embedding Input Text Analysis" sections
- ❌ Redundant executive summaries
- ❌ Conflicting status descriptions ("in progress" vs "complete")
- ❌ "UNAUTHORIZED DATABASE CHANGE" warnings (moved to action items)

## Historical Context

These files were created during a full-day investigation session on 2025-10-19:

**Morning Session:**
- Discovered vector search returns wrong results (Felodipine instead of Metformin)
- Created CRITICAL_VECTOR_SEARCH_FAILURE_ANALYSIS.md
- Hypothesized embedding text mismatch

**Midday Session:**
- Fixed char(3) truncation bug (migration 29)
- Updated test_04 documentation (prematurely declared "operational")

**Afternoon Session:**
- User intervention: "Test via RPC, not direct SQL"
- Tested real Pass 1 entities (all failed)
- Intern hypothesis: RPC is correct, embedding strategy is problem

**Evening Session:**
- Ran truth test (validated RPC works)
- Created PASS15_RPC_INVESTIGATION_FINDINGS.md
- Confirmed embedding input mismatch is root cause
- Consolidated both documents into PASS15_ROOT_CAUSE_AND_SOLUTION_PLAN.md

## Next Steps

Refer to **PASS15_ROOT_CAUSE_AND_SOLUTION_PLAN.md** for:
- Phase 1: Fast Validation Loop (1-2 hours)
- Phase 2: Normalized Embedding Implementation
- Phase 3: Hybrid Search
- Phase 4: Validation Gates
- Phase 5: Production Deployment
