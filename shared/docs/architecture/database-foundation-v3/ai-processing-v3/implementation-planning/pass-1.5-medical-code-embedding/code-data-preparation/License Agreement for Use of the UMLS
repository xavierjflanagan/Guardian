License Agreement for Use of the UMLS® Metathesaurus®
This Agreement is made by and between the National Library of Medicine, Department of Health and Human Services (hereinafter referred to as "NLM") and the LICENSEE.

WHEREAS, the NLM was established by statute in order to assist the advancement of medical and related sciences, and to aid the dissemination and exchange of scientific and other information important to the progress of medicine and to the public health (section 465 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. section 286)), and to carry out this purpose has been authorized to develop the Unified Medical Language System ® (UMLS) to facilitate the retrieval and integration of machine-readable biomedical information from disparate sources;

WHEREAS, the NLM's UMLS project has produced the UMLS Metathesaurus, a machine-readable vocabulary knowledge source, that is useful in a variety of settings;

WHEREAS, the LICENSEE is willing to use the UMLS Metathesaurus at its sole risk and at no expense to NLM, which will result in information useful to NLM, may provide immediate improvements in biomedical information transfer to segments of the biomedical community, and is consistent with NLM's statutory functions,

NOW THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed as follows:

The NLM hereby grants a nonexclusive, non-transferable right to LICENSEE to use the UMLS Metathesaurus and incorporate its content in any computer applications or systems designed to improve access to biomedical information of any type subject to the restrictions in other provisions of this Agreement. The names and addresses of licensees authorized to use the UMLS products are public information.

No charges, usage fees, or royalties will be paid to NLM.

LICENSEE is prohibited from distributing the UMLS Metathesaurus or subsets of it, including individual vocabulary sources within the Metathesaurus, except (a) as an integral part of computer applications developed by LICENSEE for a purpose other than redistribution of vocabulary sources contained in the UMLS Metathesaurus and (b) if permitted by paragraph 12 of this agreement.

LICENSEE agrees to inform NLM prior to distributing any application(s) in which it is using the UMLS Metathesaurus and is encouraged to inform NLM of any difficulties encountered in using the UMLS Metathesaurus, and changes or enhancements to the UMLS Metathesaurus that would make it more useful to LICENSEE and its user groups.

Within 30 days of the end of any calendar year in which LICENSEE makes use of the UMLS Metathesaurus, LICENSEE agrees to provide NLM with a brief report on the usefulness of the UMLS Metathesaurus in general and, if applicable, on the usefulness of CPT in the UMLS format in particular. LICENSEE is strongly encouraged to submit to NLM locally developed extensions to the UMLS Metathesaurus that are potentially useful to other UMLS users for consideration for potential inclusion in the UMLS Metathesaurus.

NLM represents that the data provided under this Agreement were formatted with a reasonable standard of care, but makes no warranties express or implied, including no warranty of merchantability or fitness for particular purpose, regarding the accuracy or completeness of the data or that the machine-readable copy is error free. Therefore, LICENSEE agrees to hold NLM, the Government, and any organization contributing a vocabulary source to the UMLS Metathesaurus free from any liability resulting from errors in terminology or other data or on the machine-readable copy. NLM and such other organizations disclaim any liability for any consequences due to use, misuse, or interpretation of information contained or not contained in the UMLS Metathesaurus.

NLM represents that its ability to continue to include certain vocabulary sources within the UMLS Metathesaurus is dependent on continuing contractual relations or agreements with the copyright holders for these vocabulary sources. Therefore, LICENSEE agrees to hold NLM and the individual copyright holder free from any liability resulting from the removal of any vocabulary source from future editions of the UMLS Metathesaurus.

NLM reserves the right to change the type and format of its machine-readable data. NLM agrees to inform LICENSEE of any changes to the format of the UMLS Metathesaurus, EXCEPT the addition of entirely new data elements to the Metathesaurus, at least 90 days before the data are distributed.

The presence in the UMLS Metathesaurus of vocabulary or data produced by organizations other than NLM does not imply any endorsement of the UMLS Metathesaurus by these organizations.

LICENSEE shall acknowledge NLM as its source of the UMLS Metathesaurus, citing the year and version number, in a suitable and customary manner but may not in any way indicate or imply that NLM or any of the organizations whose vocabulary sources are included in the UMLS has endorsed LICENSEE or its products.

Some of the Material in the UMLS Metathesaurus is from copyrighted sources. If LICENSEE uses any material from copyrighted sources from the UMLS Metathesaurus:

a) the LICENSEE is required to display in full, prior to providing user access to the Metathesaurus or any of the vocabulary sources within the UMLS, the following wording in order that its users be made aware of these copyright constraints:

"Some material in the UMLS Metathesaurus is from copyrighted sources of the respective copyright holders.

By downloading, accessing or using any part of the International Release of SNOMED CT or a Member's National Release of SNOMED CT, or exercising any rights granted under this License Agreement, the Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms of this License Agreement.

License Fees and other conditions and restrictions apply to the use of the International Release of SNOMED CT in a Non-Member Territory, and to the deployment, distribution and licensing of Licensee Products within a Non-Member Territory. In this regard the Licensee's attention is drawn in particular to clause 7 (License Fees) and clause 9 (Use in Member Territories and Non-Member Territories) .

1. DEFINED TERMS AND INTERPRETATION

1.1 In this License Agreement, terms defined in Appendix A ( Defined Terms ) have the meanings set out in that Appendix.

1.2 In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the English language version and any other language version of this License Agreement, the English language version shall take precedence.

2. GRANT OF LICENSE

2.1 The Licensor grants the Licensee, subject to the terms of this License Agreement, a perpetual (subject to revocation in accordance with clause 5 ), worldwide, non- exclusive, non-transferable license for the term of this License Agreement to:

2.1.1 use, and permit the Licensee's officers, employees, agents and contractors to use, the International Release;

2.2.2 in the development and operation of the Licensee's information systems;

2.2.3 for the Licensee's research purposes;

2.2.4 in the Licensee's systems (including browsers and data analysis systems) made available to the general public for accessing and/or retrieving any part of the International Release and/or data encoded using the foregoing, provided that users of those systems are not able to extract any substantial portion of SNOMED CT and provided further that no fee is charged for access to those systems except where access is incidental to the provision of training or consulting services; and/or

2.2.5 to transmit to third parties messages that contain patient information encoded using SNOMED CT, provided that the SNOMED CT Content contained within those messages consists solely of SNOMED CT Identifiers and descriptions of SNOMED CT concepts.

2.4 The Licensee is not permitted to translate any part of the International Release into any other human language without the prior written consent of the Licensor.

2.5.2 not permit the End User to do any act or thing in respect of the International Release that the Licensee is prohibited from doing under this License Agreement;

2.5.3 not permit the End User to sub-license or transfer any of its rights under the sub-license (unless the End User is also an Affiliate, in which case that Affiliate shall be entitled to sub-license further its rights under the sub- license with the Licensee, subject to the same restrictions as apply to sub- licensing the International Release under the Affiliate's license agreement with the Licensor);

2.5.4 terminate automatically upon termination of this License Agreement;

(b) give the End User an assurance or undertaking that for a limited period the Licensor will not seek to prevent the End User from using the Licensee Products; and

2.5.6 permit the Licensee to disclose the terms of the sub-license to the Licensor in accordance with clauses 7 and 8 .

2.7 The Licensee shall implement reasonable measures to ensure that the International Release (and any part of it) cannot be accessed or downloaded from the Licensees systems except by authorised users, and shall comply with the security measures that the Licensor prescribes by Regulations and notifies to the Licensee from time to time.

3.1 The Licensee may not create any Standards-Based Extension or any Standards Based Derivative unless it has first been issued with a Namespace Identifier by or on behalf of the Licensor.

3.4 Subject to clauses 3.5 and 3.6 , the Licensee shall own all Intellectual Property Rights in all Extensions and Derivatives that the Licensee creates under this License Agreement.

Upon receipt of such written notice, the Licensor shall consult with the Licensee and shall give due consideration as to whether the proposed modification should be made based on the Licensor's editorial guidelines and policies. Following due consideration of the matter, including consideration of any information presented by the Licensee, the Licensor shall inform the Licensee whether the proposed modification shall be made and if the Licensor agrees that the proposed modification should be made, the Licensor shall give a non-binding indication of when, reasonably and in good faith, it anticipates that the proposed modification will be made. If the Licensee would like the content of the proposed modification to be developed more quickly than the Licensor has indicated, the Licensee may itself undertake or procure the undertaking of the development of the content of the proposed modification (outside of any existing Licensor's support services contract). On receipt of the developed content of the proposed modification, the Licensor will then give due consideration as to whether the developed content meets the Licensor's quality assurance, other governance processes, Standards and Regulations. If the developed content meets the Licensor's quality assurance, other governance processes, Standards and Regulations then the Licensor shall incorporate the modification into the SNOMED CT Core according to its schedule which will give due consideration as to when the proposed modification shall be incorporated into the SNOMED CT Core, taking into account other proposals for the modification of the SNOMED CT Core and the work required to include the proposed modification in the SNOMED CT Core.

1.1 This Appendix B sets out the license fees payable by the Licensee in respect of its activities in Non-Member Territories.

1.2 The license fees set out in this Appendix B do not apply in respect of the Licensee's activities in any Non-Member Territory if that Non-Member Territory is a Sponsored Territory or was a Sponsored Territory at the time when the Licensee's activities in that Non-Member Territory were carried out.

1.3 The Licensor may, in its sole discretion, waive the Licensee's obligation to pay any or all of the license fees set out in this Appendix B if the Licensor considers that the Licensee's activities in any Non-Member Territory are in support of charitable or humanitarian causes in that Non-Member Territory. Any waiver by the Licensor under this paragraph 1.3 may be revoked by the Licensor at any time, shall be without prejudice to any of the Licensor's other rights and remedies under this License Agreement and shall not relieve the Licensee of any of its other obligations under this License Agreement.

1.4 Beginning in 2015, license fees payable by the Licensee in respect of its activities in Non-Member Territories for each financial year shall be adjusted by the same percentage as the General Assembly of the Licensor agrees to adjust the Aggregate Annual Fee (as defined in the Licensor's Articles of Association) relative to the Aggregate Annual Fee in the previous year.

1.5 For purposes of this Appendix B, but subject to paragraph 1.6, if a Hospital or a Practice is located on multiple physical sites, each such site shall be treated as a separate Hospital or Practice (as the case may be), and license fees shall be payable in respect of each such separate Hospital or Practice.

1.9 In any case where the Licensee is exempt from the requirement to pay license fees by reason of a Licensee Product or a Data Processing System being used exclusively in connection with a Qualifying Research Project, the Licensee shall report to the Licensor on the progress of that Qualifying Research Project in such manner as the Licensor may reasonably require. The Licensor may revoke the Licensee's exemption for Qualifying Research Projects provided in this Appendix B if the Licensee fails to comply with this paragraph 1.9.
