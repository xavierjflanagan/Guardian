  Lines 149-160 show semantic uses the embedding of the first matching code, not the entity text:

  -- This selects embedding from FIRST code that matches
  SELECT embedding INTO v_query_embedding
  FROM regional_medical_codes
  WHERE normalized_embedding_text ILIKE '%chest%' OR ...
  LIMIT 1;  -- ← First match wins!

  So semantic similarity is comparing "code A" to "first matched code's embedding", not to "Chest X-ray embedding".

  Does this match your understanding of what SHOULD happen? Or was the 70/30 weighting intentional?

> mmm i see, so i think " -- Step 3: Final score (line 244)
  combined_score = (lexical_score * 0.70) + (semantic_score * 0.30)
  ORDER BY combined_score DESC" doesnt make sense or is not what i want - instead of that, is there anyway to rank lexical
 search/filtering based on how many of the key words are present (including variant)? I.e for the example of "Radiology 
code 58500:
  - Text: "Chest (lung fields) by direct radiography"" this code would appear high in the rank (and hence make it onto the
 shortlist) because it has two key words in it that were in the original search word list (chest nad radiograph) - this 
could maybe be achieved function wise by searching each key word as well as the 5 variants and whichever code gets the 
most pings/matches is ranked highest - but maybe you have a smarter way to build this function using clever code.  Then on
 top of this, we could either A) not apply any semantic functions, B) applys emantic functions to add 'wildcard' codes 
above a certain similarity threshold.        2. ANother idea i had last night was to get AI to run through every row in 
the MBS table and convert the fluffy distracting text into a clean sumamrized version that we cna then embed, how long 
would this take to do and cost and what are pros and cons of this approach? 

⏺ Excellent diagnosis! You've identified the core issue. Let me address both ideas:

  Solution 1: Keyword Match Count Ranking (RECOMMENDED)

  Your idea is exactly right. Instead of "which variant matched" (positional scoring), count "how many keywords matched"
  (coverage scoring).

  Example - "Chest (lung fields) by direct radiography":
  - Matches: "chest" ✓, "radiograph" ✓ (substring of "radiography")
  - Score: 2/5 variants = 0.4 (or raw count = 2)

  Example - "Anaesthesia for chest wall":
  - Matches: "chest" ✓
  - Score: 1/5 variants = 0.2 (or raw count = 1)

  Proposed Algorithm Change

  -- Instead of positional scoring (1.0, 0.95, 0.90...)
  -- Count total keyword matches
  SELECT
      code_value,
      display_name,
      (
          (CASE WHEN text ILIKE '%chest%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) +
          (CASE WHEN text ILIKE '%radiograph%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) +
          (CASE WHEN text ILIKE '%thorax%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) +
          (CASE WHEN text ILIKE '%cxr%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) +
          (CASE WHEN text ILIKE '%lung%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
      )::NUMERIC / 5.0 AS lexical_score  -- Normalize to 0-1 range
  WHERE
      -- At least ONE variant must match to get into shortlist
      (text ILIKE '%chest%' OR text ILIKE '%radiograph%' OR ...)
  ORDER BY lexical_score DESC

  This naturally ranks codes with more keyword coverage higher.

  ---
  Semantic Options

  Option A: Pure Lexical (No Semantic)
  - Fastest, simplest
  - No proxy embedding bias
  - Relies entirely on keyword match count
  - Recommended for testing

  Option B: Semantic Wildcard
  - Keep lexical shortlist
  - Add high-similarity codes (e.g., cosine > 0.85) even if no keyword match
  - Could catch edge cases
  - More complex, slower

  ---
  Solution 2: AI MBS Cleaning

  Cost & Time Estimate:
  - 6,001 MBS codes to clean
  - GPT-4o-mini: $0.15/1M input, $0.60/1M output
  - ~100 tokens input + ~30 tokens output per code
  - Total cost: ~$0.60
  - Time: ~10-15 minutes (batch processing)

  Pros:
  - Remove billing fluff: "if: (a) the immunisation is provided on behalf of, and under the supervision of, a medical
  practitioner"
  - Cleaner embeddings: "Chest radiography" instead of "Chest (lung fields) by direct radiography (NR)"
  - One-time preprocessing cost

  Cons:
  - AI might lose critical terminology
  - Maintenance burden (MBS updates quarterly)
  - Still won't fix "CT" → "Computed tomography" mismatch (that's in the original description)
  - If lexical keyword matching works, this becomes unnecessary

  ---
  My Recommendation

  Phase 1: Fix Lexical Ranking (Quick Win)
  1. Change scoring from positional to match-count
  2. Remove semantic component entirely (Option A)
  3. Re-run Experiment 6
  4. Hypothesis: This alone might achieve ≥90% accuracy

  Phase 2 (If Needed): AI Cleaning
  - Only pursue if keyword ranking still fails
  - $0.60 cost is negligible, but maintenance is the real cost

  ---
  Next Steps

  Would you like me to:
  1. Create Migration 33 with the keyword-count lexical ranking?
  2. Re-run Experiment 6 with the new algorithm?
  3. Both?

  The migration would take ~15 minutes to write and test. The re-run would take ~2 minutes to execute.

> you didnt answer my question and you didnt follow migration_history readmd.md protocol 

⏺ You're absolutely right - I apologize. Let me answer your question first and follow the proper protocol.

  Answer to your question:
  Yes, we're updating Experiment 6 in-place, not creating new experiments. The changes are:
  1. Migration 33 - Replace the database function
  2. Experiment 6 docs - Update to reflect new algorithm (explain match-count vs positional)
  3. Experiment 6 scripts - No changes needed (they just call the function)
  4. Re-run same test - Same 35 entities, same expected codes, new results

  Now let me follow the Two-Touchpoint Workflow from migration_history/README.md:

  Touchpoint 1: Research + Create Script (for review)

  Let me read the migration README first to understand the proper procedure:

⏺ Read(~/Documents/GitHub/Guardian-Cursor/shared/docs/architecture/database-foundation-v3/migration_history/README.md)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines

⏺ Bash(grep -n "CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION search_procedures_hybrid" 03_clinical_core.sql)

⏺ Bash(grep -n "END;" 03_clinical_core.sql | awk -F: '$1 > 2018 {print; exit}')
  ⎿  2167:END;

⏺ Perfect. Here's the proper Touchpoint 1 presentation:

  ---
  TOUCHPOINT 1: Research + Create Script

  1. Current System Behavior (Verified)

  Function: search_procedures_hybrid() (Migration 32)
  Location: 03_clinical_core.sql lines 2018-2167
  Algorithm: Positional variant scoring (1.0, 0.95, 0.90...) + 70/30 lexical/semantic weighting

  Verified Issue:
  - Experiment 6 Results: 35.7% top-20 accuracy (target: ≥90%)
  - Codes matching same keyword get same positional score
  - Example: "chest" in anaesthesia code = 1.0, "chest" in radiology code = 1.0
  - Semantic component uses proxy embedding from first matched code (biased)

  2. What Needs to Change

  Replace: Positional scoring → Match-count scoring
  Remove: Semantic component entirely (Phase 1 pure lexical)
  Keep: API signature unchanged (backward compatible)

  3. Source of Truth Files to Update

  File: current_schema/03_clinical_core.sql
  Lines: 2018-2167 (150 lines - full function replacement)
  Change: Replace entire search_procedures_hybrid() function with keyword match-count algorithm

  4. Migration Script Created

  File: migration_history/2025-10-23_33_fix_hybrid_search_keyword_count.sql
  Status: Created, ready for review

  Algorithm Change:
  -- OLD (Positional scoring):
  CASE WHEN text ILIKE '%variant[1]%' THEN 1.00
       WHEN text ILIKE '%variant[2]%' THEN 0.95
       ...

  -- NEW (Match-count scoring):
  (
    (CASE WHEN text ILIKE '%variant[1]%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) +
    (CASE WHEN text ILIKE '%variant[2]%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) +
    ...
  ) / total_variants  -- Normalize to 0-1 range

  5. Impact Summary

  Tables Affected: None (function change only)
  Breaking Changes: None (API signature identical)
  Performance: Same or better (removed semantic embedding lookup)
  Risk Level: Low (pure algorithm change, no schema changes)

  ---
  Ready for Review

  Migration script: /migration_history/2025-10-23_33_fix_hybrid_search_keyword_count.sql

  Should I proceed to Touchpoint 2 (execute migration)? Or would you like to review the migration script first?

> here is the reveiw fo th script: I'll open the migration file to review its contents for syntax, safety, and logic.

[1 tool called]

Here’s a concise review of Migration 33 with focused suggestions.

- Overall: Logic is clear and safer for Phase 1. Pure lexical match-count ranking fixes the core ranking flaw from 
Migration 32. Good normalization, cap to 5, deterministic ordering, and API compatibility via semantic/combined 
placeholders.

- Correctness
  - Keyword coverage scoring is correctly computed and normalized by variant count.
  - Deterministic ranking added (secondary `code_value` sort) — good.
```145:146:/Users/xflanagan/Documents/GitHub/Guardian-Cursor/shared/docs/architecture/database-foundation-v3/migration_his
tory/2025-10-23_33_fix_hybrid_search_keyword_count.sql
ORDER BY km.match_count DESC, km.code_value ASC  -- Secondary sort for deterministic ordering
LIMIT p_limit;
```

- Important suggestions
  - Filter empty variants after trim to avoid accidental “match everything” via `ILIKE '%%'`. Currently, empty strings 
would still be included after trimming.
```90:98:/Users/xflanagan/Documents/GitHub/Guardian-Cursor/shared/docs/architecture/database-foundation-v3/migration_histo
ry/2025-10-23_33_fix_hybrid_search_keyword_count.sql
SELECT array_agg(trim(v)) INTO v_normalized_variants
FROM unnest(p_search_variants) AS v;

-- Enforce 5-variant cap (silent truncation)
IF array_length(v_normalized_variants, 1) > 5 THEN
    v_normalized_variants := v_normalized_variants[1:5];
END IF;
```
  - Security/permissions alignment: You’re using SECURITY DEFINER but granting to `authenticated` without revoking public;
 also Migration 32 used a stricter `service_role`. Recommend revoking from PUBLIC and granting only the intended role 
(whichever you standardize on).
```148:152:/Users/xflanagan/Documents/GitHub/Guardian-Cursor/shared/docs/architecture/database-foundation-v3/migration_his
tory/2025-10-23_33_fix_hybrid_search_keyword_count.sql
$ LANGUAGE plpgsql STABLE SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Grant execute to authenticated users
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION search_procedures_hybrid TO authenticated;
```
  - Harden SECURITY DEFINER with explicit search_path to prevent search path hijacking.
```148:148:/Users/xflanagan/Documents/GitHub/Guardian-Cursor/shared/docs/architecture/database-foundation-v3/migration_his
tory/2025-10-23_33_fix_hybrid_search_keyword_count.sql
$ LANGUAGE plpgsql STABLE SECURITY DEFINER;
```
  - Comment signature: Include parameter types to avoid ambiguity and match the convention used in Migration 32.
```154:162:/Users/xflanagan/Documents/GitHub/Guardian-Cursor/shared/docs/architecture/database-foundation-v3/migration_his
tory/2025-10-23_33_fix_hybrid_search_keyword_count.sql
COMMENT ON FUNCTION search_procedures_hybrid IS
'Hybrid search for MBS procedure codes (Phase 1: Pure lexical with keyword match-count ranking).
...
```

- Performance notes
  - This function relies on `ILIKE` queries on `normalized_embedding_text`; ensure the trigram index added in Migration 32
 is present and used (it is, by design). Consider a quick EXPLAIN ANALYZE during processing to confirm index usage on your
 dataset and verify sub-500ms latency at your scale.

- API compatibility
  - Keeping `semantic_score`, `combined_score`, and `match_source` is smart for downstream stability. If you want 
observability, optionally consider adding `match_count` in the future; not required now.

- Verification guidance
  - Your verification block is good. For completeness, also verify permissions after processing (grants) and confirm index
 usage via EXPLAIN on a representative test query.

Bottom line
- Good to process. Address the empty-variant filter and the SECURITY DEFINER hardening/permissions alignment to avoid 
surprise matches and overexposure.

⏺ Perfect! All review items addressed:

  Updated Migration 33 - Changes Applied

  1. Empty Variant Filter (Security)
  -- Before: Could match ILIKE '%%' if variant was empty
  SELECT array_agg(trim(v)) INTO v_normalized_variants
  FROM unnest(p_search_variants) AS v;

  -- After: Filters empty strings to prevent accidental match-all
  SELECT array_agg(trim(v)) INTO v_normalized_variants
  FROM unnest(p_search_variants) AS v
  WHERE trim(v) != '';

  -- Added validation
  IF v_normalized_variants IS NULL OR array_length(v_normalized_variants, 1) = 0 THEN
      RAISE EXCEPTION 'All search_variants are empty after trimming';
  END IF;

  2. SECURITY DEFINER Hardening
  $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql STABLE SECURITY DEFINER
  SET search_path = public;  -- Prevents search path hijacking

  3. Permissions (Aligned with Migration 32)
  -- Revoke from PUBLIC first
  REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION search_procedures_hybrid(TEXT, TEXT[], CHAR(3), INTEGER) FROM PUBLIC;
  -- Grant only to service_role (matches Migration 32 pattern)
  GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION search_procedures_hybrid(TEXT, TEXT[], CHAR(3), INTEGER) TO service_role;

  4. Comment Signature (With Parameter Types)
  COMMENT ON FUNCTION search_procedures_hybrid(TEXT, TEXT[], CHAR(3), INTEGER) IS
  'Hybrid search for MBS procedure codes...
  Parameters:

        9    ## Overview
       10    
       11 -  This experiment tests the hybrid search function created in Migration 32
          -   against the same 35 MBS procedure entities from Experiment 5.
       11 +  This experiment tests the keyword match-count search function (Migration 33)
          +   against the same 35 MBS procedure entities from Experiment 5.
       12    
       13 -  **Hypothesis:** Hybrid search (Lexical 70% + Semantic 30%) will achieve ≥90% top-20 accuracy, solving the 
          - failures discovered in Experiment 5.
       13 +  **Hypothesis:** Pure lexical keyword match-count ranking will achieve ≥90% top-20 accuracy.
       14    
       15 +  ## Algorithm Evolution
       16 +  
       17 +  **Migration 32 (Oct 22):** Initial hybrid - Positional scoring + 70/30 lexical/semantic
       18 +  - **Result:** 35.7% top-20 accuracy (FAILED)
       19 +  - **Issue:** Same keyword → same positional score, semantic proxy was biased
       20 +  
       21 +  **Migration 33 (Oct 23):** Keyword match-count - Pure lexical, count matching variants
       22 +  - **Strategy:** More keywords matched = higher rank (e.g., "chest"+"radiograph" = 2/5 score)
       23 +  - **Target:** ≥90% top-20 accuracy

  Decision: TUNE (Scenario 2)

  Status: Below 90% target but strong progressNext Steps:
  1. Investigate why 4 entities still failing
  2. Improve search variant quality (add medical synonyms)
  3. Consider algorithm enhancements (position scoring, term frequency)
  4. If still <90%, try AI MBS cleaning ($0.60, 15 mins)

  Your call: Should we investigate the 4 failures now, or is 71.4% acceptable for Phase 1?

> Ta I'm still a bit confused. By the way you are expressing the results of that experiment test. All I really want to know is
 if we if her past one extracted output clinical entity is inserted into pass 1.5 Will the exact match medical code appear in 
the top 20 what is the percentage of that happening? And then also what's the percentage of it happening in the top 10 and the
 top five and the top one? Have you looked to see what the actual expected? Optimal retrieved code is for the 35 clinical that
 you used as the test data? And yes after you respond to my questions here we need to investigate the remaining for failures 
but I also want to make sure that the successes are actually successes and they actually did return the exact match that 
should've been returned in an ideal world. 

⏺ You're absolutely right to question this. Let me clarify:

  Current Ground Truth Coverage Problem

  I only have verified expected codes for 14/35 entities (the other 21 are marked "TBD"). So I can ONLY measure accuracy for
  those 14.

  Let me verify the "successes" are actually returning the CORRECT codes, not just "any" codes:

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/xflanagan/Documents/GitHub/Guardian-Cursor/shared/docs/architecture/database-foundation-v3/ai-processing-v3/imple
      mentation-planning/pass-1.5-medical-c…)
  ⎿  {                                   
       "entity_id": 14,
       "entity_text": "Blood collection",
     … +122 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ CRITICAL FINDING - The "successes" aren't all Top-1!

  Looking at actual codes returned:

  Blood collection (Expected: 13839):
  - Top-1: 13306 ❌ WRONG
  - Position: #8 in top-10 ✓

  Chest X-ray (Expected: 58500/58503/58506):
  - Top-1: 58500 ✓ CORRECT
  - Top-3: All 3 expected codes ✓ PERFECT

  Cholecystectomy (Expected: 30443/30445/30448):
  - Top-1: 30520 ❌ WRONG
  - Positions: #9 (30445), #10 (30448) ✓

  Inguinal hernia (Expected: 44114):
  - Top-1: 30648 ❌ WRONG
  - Position: #6 ✓

  Total hip replacement (Expected: 49318/49315):
  - Top-1: 48921 ❌ WRONG
  - Position: #6 (49318), missing 49315 entirely

  Let me calculate proper Top-1/5/10/20 accuracy for all 14 entities:

  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> before you do anything more, to  reiterate all I care about is weather the exact correct medical code appears in the top 20 
because we'll be sending the top 20 to pass 2 to manually go through and pick out the Best match so all I care about is is it 
showing up in the top 20 for each of the 35 entities that we used as our input tester for this experiment so I want you to 
create a file that spells out in in a human readable format each entity and the top 20 returned values from the MBS. Don't 
make up anything needs to be the actual output from the function and then I want you to go through each block of 20 and 
determine if you think there's an exact match or if you think there might not be an exact match and flag it because this is 
kind of what past two will be doing it'll be going through the top 20 and seeing if there's an exact match or not that seems 
right if it feels like there isn't an exact match it'll just leave it now. Better be safe than sorry then if you have already 
or if you haven't yet after that we will go through and find and try and manually find if there are any better matches or more
 optimal matches in the MBS table does that make sense? 

⏺ Perfect! That makes total sense. Let me create a human-readable file showing each entity's top-20 results with my assessment
   of whether there's an exact match.
