## Text Strategy Comparison

**Critical Finding:** Normalized text outperforms ingredient-only extraction for medications!

### SapBERT Performance by Strategy

| Strategy | Medications | Procedures | Overall | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------|-------|
| **Normalized** | **33.2%** | 49.1% | **41.2%** | ✅ Best overall |
| Original | 33.6% | 48.9% | 41.3% | Very close to normalized |
| Core (Ingredient) | **38.6%** | 49.0% | 43.8% | ❌ 5.4pp worse for medications |

**Key Insight:** The ingredient-only approach (core strategy) actually performs WORSE than normalized text:
- **Medications:** 38.6% vs 33.2% (5.4 percentage points worse)
- **Procedures:** Nearly identical performance (49.0% vs 49.1%)

### OpenAI Performance by Strategy

| Strategy | Medications | Procedures | Overall |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------|
| **Normalized** | **50.5%** | 50.1% | **50.3%** |
| Original | 54.6% | 50.1% | 52.4% |
| Core (Ingredient) | 54.8% | 50.1% | 52.4% |

**Same pattern:** Normalized text is 4.3pp better than ingredient-only for medications.

### Why Normalized Beats Ingredient-Only

**Initial Hypothesis (from earlier testing):**
- Ingredient-only should provide better differentiation by removing noise (dosage, form, salt forms)

**Actual Results:**
- Normalized text retains enough structural information to aid differentiation
- Complete removal of context (ingredient-only) actually loses valuable semantic signals
- Examples:
  - "Amoxicillin Capsule 500 mg" (normalized) vs "amoxicillin capsule" (core)
  - Normalized retains dosage context that helps distinguish from combination products
  - Normalized retains form information that provides additional differentiation signal

### Recommendation

**Use normalized text (existing `normalized_embedding_text` column)** rather than further extraction to ingredient-only:
- Better performance across all models
- Simpler implementation (no additional text processing required)
- Already populated in database

---

## Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation: SapBERT with Normalized Text

**Use Case:** All medical code differentiation tasks

**Advantages:**
- Consistently better differentiation across all entity types
- Particularly strong for medication differentiation (33.2% avg similarity)
- Pre-trained on medical entity linking (UMLS)
- Free tier available (HuggingFace API)

**Implementation:**
```
Model: cambridgeltl/SapBERT-from-PubMedBERT-fulltext
Text: normalized_embedding_text column
Dimensions: 768
API: HuggingFace Inference with mean pooling
```

---

## Conclusion

SapBERT with normalized text strategy provides the best overall performance for medical code differentiation, with particularly strong results for medication differentiation. The 9.1-point improvement over OpenAI baseline translates to significantly better ability to distinguish between similar medical codes, which is critical for accurate medical code matching and search functionality.
