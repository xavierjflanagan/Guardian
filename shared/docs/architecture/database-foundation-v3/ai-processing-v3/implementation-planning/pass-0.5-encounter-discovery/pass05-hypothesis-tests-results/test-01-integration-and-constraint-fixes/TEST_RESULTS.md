# Test 01: Integration & Database Constraint Fixes

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Test Type:** Worker integration + database constraint debugging
**Status:** PARTIAL SUCCESS
**Next Test:** Test 02 (End-to-End Production Flow)

---

## Test Summary

**Objective:** Integrate Pass 0.5 into worker.ts and validate basic database operations

**Result:** ✅ Integration successful, ❌ Quality issues identified

---

## What Was Tested

### Test Attempts Executed

**Attempt 1-4:** Database constraint violations
- Fixed session_status (in_progress → processing)
- Fixed session_type (full_pipeline → shell_file_processing)
- Fixed workflow_step (pass_0_5_encounter_discovery → entity_detection)
- Reverted ai_model_name to 'gpt-5-mini' per user requirement

**Attempt 5 (Job f86f4575):** Pass 0.5 succeeded, Pass 1 failed
- ✅ Pass 0.5 ran fresh (not cached)
- ✅ Created 2 encounters in database
- ✅ Created manifest and metrics
- ❌ Pass 1 failed with duplicate key error on ai_processing_sessions

**Attempt 6 (Job f5a2fb1f):** Full pipeline success
- ⚠️ Pass 0.5 hit idempotency cache (used results from Attempt 5)
- ✅ Pass 1 succeeded with UPSERT fix
- ✅ Full job completed after 8.2 minutes

### Test File Used

**File:** `BP2025060246784 - first 2 page version V4.jpeg`
- **Type:** Patient Health Summary (1 page, JPEG)
- **Size:** 69,190 bytes
- **Storage:** d1dbe18c-afc2-421f-bd58-145ddb48cbca/1760835199418...
- **Shell File ID:** 22d23e0e-88a0-4620-8ac3-3259c7009f5b

## Validations Completed ✅

### 6 Database Validation Queries (All Passed)

1. ✅ **Manifest exists** - Complete with metadata
2. ✅ **Encounters pre-created** - 2 encounters with UUIDs
3. ✅ **Metrics populated** - Token counts, confidence scores
4. ✅ **Completion flags set** - pass_0_5_completed = true
5. ✅ **Atomic transaction** - All 3 writes succeeded
6. ✅ **Idempotency working** - Safe to retry without duplicates

### Pass 0.5 Performance Metrics

- **Encounters Found:** 2 (pseudo_medication_list, pseudo_lab_report)
- **Processing Time:** 6.4 seconds ✅ (target: <10s)
- **AI Cost:** $0.000397 ✅ (target: <$0.05)
- **Average Confidence:** 0.88 ✅ (target: ≥0.85)
- **AI Model:** gpt-4o-mini
- **OCR Confidence:** 0.97

---

## Issues Identified ❌

### 1. False Positive Encounter Detection

**Problem:** AI detected 2 encounters when only 1 exists

**Detected:**
- `pseudo_medication_list` ✅ CORRECT
- `pseudo_lab_report` ❌ FALSE POSITIVE

**Ground Truth:**
- Document is a Patient Health Summary (administrative)
- Contains: Medications, immunizations, past history, surgeries
- Does NOT contain: Lab results, pathology, test values

**Expected:**
- 1 encounter: `pseudo_admin_summary` or `pseudo_health_summary`

**Impact:** **Precision problem** - AI is too aggressive in splitting documents

### 2. Spatial Data Not Validated

**Problem:** Did not verify spatial bounding box data

**Missing Validations:**
- Page range assignment (page_range_start, page_range_end)
- Manifest JSONB structure (pageRanges array)
- Spatial coordinate data
- Pass 1 use of spatial data for entity assignment

**Impact:** Cannot confirm spatial matching functionality works

### 3. Idempotency Cache Skipped Full Test

**Problem:** Attempt 6 (successful test) used cached Pass 0.5 results

**What Happened:**
- Attempt 5: Pass 0.5 ran fresh, created encounters/manifest
- Attempt 6: Pass 0.5 returned cached results (idempotency check)
- Logs: "Shell file already processed, returning existing result"

**Impact:** Attempt 6 didn't truly re-test Pass 0.5 encounter discovery logic

### 4. Pass 1 Integration Not Validated

**Problem:** Did not verify Pass 1 actually used the encounter manifest

**Missing Checks:**
- Did Pass 1 load manifest_data?
- Were entities assigned to encounters?
- Does entity-to-encounter spatial matching work?
- Are assigned_encounter_id fields populated?

**Impact:** Cannot confirm Pass 0.5 → Pass 1 integration is operational

## Fixes Applied During Test

### Fix 1: Session Status Constraint
**Error:** `session_status: 'in_progress'` violates check constraint
**Fix:** Changed to `'processing'` (valid value)
**File:** apps/render-worker/src/worker.ts:731

### Fix 2: Session Type Constraint
**Error:** `session_type: 'full_pipeline'` violates check constraint
**Fix:** Changed to `'shell_file_processing'` (valid value)
**File:** apps/render-worker/src/worker.ts:730

### Fix 3: Workflow Step Constraint
**Error:** `workflow_step: 'pass_0_5_encounter_discovery'` violates check constraint
**Fix:** Changed to `'entity_detection'` (valid value)
**File:** apps/render-worker/src/worker.ts:733

### Fix 4: AI Model Name Revert
**Error:** Unauthorized change from 'gpt-5-mini' to 'gpt-4o'
**Fix:** Reverted to 'gpt-5-mini' per user requirement
**File:** apps/render-worker/src/worker.ts:732

### Fix 5: Duplicate Key Error (CRITICAL)
**Error:** Pass 1 tried to INSERT ai_processing_sessions with same ID created before Pass 0.5
**Fix:** Changed INSERT to UPSERT in `insertPass1DatabaseRecords()`
**File:** apps/render-worker/src/worker.ts:906
**Code:**
```typescript
// Before:
.insert(records.ai_processing_session)

// After:
.upsert(records.ai_processing_session, { onConflict: 'id' })
```

## Test Methodology Issues

### Partial Test Execution

**What Was Tested:**
- ✅ Worker integration (Pass 0.5 inserted into pipeline)
- ✅ Database constraint compliance
- ✅ Atomic transactions
- ✅ Idempotency safety
- ✅ UPSERT fix for Pass 1

**What Was NOT Tested:**
- ❌ Spatial data population (page ranges, bbox coordinates)
- ❌ Encounter detection accuracy (false positives found)
- ❌ Pass 1 manifest loading
- ❌ Entity-to-encounter assignment
- ❌ Full production flow (manual UI upload)

### Test Approach Limitations

1. **Automated job injection** - Used SQL to enqueue jobs directly
   - Skipped: UI upload, Edge Function, Storage write
   - Only tested: Job queue → Worker → Processing

2. **Cached results** - Successful test used idempotency cache
   - Pass 0.5 logic not fully re-executed
   - Cannot confirm fresh execution works reliably

3. **Validation scope** - Only ran 6 database queries
   - Did not inspect manifest_data JSONB structure
   - Did not validate spatial coordinate data
   - Did not check Pass 1 integration

---

## Lessons for Test 02

### Must Validate

1. **Encounter Accuracy** - Manual review of detected encounters vs ground truth
2. **Spatial Data** - Inspect manifest_data JSONB, verify page ranges
3. **Pass 1 Integration** - Check entity assignment to encounters
4. **Fresh Execution** - Use new file to avoid idempotency cache
5. **Production Flow** - Manual UI upload to test full pipeline

### Test Improvements

1. **Use manual upload** - Test full production flow (UI → Edge Function → Worker)
2. **New file** - Avoid cache hits, test fresh Pass 0.5 execution
3. **Comprehensive validation** - 10 phases, 50+ validation points
4. **Ground truth** - Known document content for accuracy comparison
5. **Pass 1 checks** - Verify manifest loading and entity assignment

## Deployment History

**Commits During Test 01:**
1. e538252 - Fix comprehensive constraint violations
2. 85bd074 - Fix UPSERT for ai_processing_sessions

**Deployment Status:** Live on Render.com (srv-d2qkja56ubrc73dh13q0)

---

## Success Criteria Met

### What Worked ✅

1. **Worker Integration** - Pass 0.5 runs between OCR and Pass 1
2. **Constraint Compliance** - All database constraints satisfied
3. **Performance** - Cost ($0.0004) and time (6.4s) under targets
4. **Atomic Writes** - Manifest/metrics/shell_files written together
5. **Idempotency** - Safe to retry, returns cached results
6. **UPSERT Fix** - Pass 1 no longer fails on duplicate session

### What Needs Work ❌

1. **Encounter Quality** - False positive lab_report detection
2. **Spatial Validation** - Page ranges not verified
3. **Pass 1 Integration** - Manifest loading not confirmed
4. **Production Flow** - Only tested worker, not full UI → Worker pipeline

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Execute Test 02** with comprehensive validation plan
2. **Manual upload** via production UI (not SQL job injection)
3. **Validate spatial data** - Check manifest_data JSONB structure
4. **Verify Pass 1 integration** - Confirm entity-to-encounter assignment

### Future Improvements

1. **Improve AI prompt** - Reduce false positive encounter detection
2. **Add validation layer** - Verify encounter types match document content
3. **Enhanced logging** - Log manifest loading in Pass 1
4. **Spatial data tests** - Dedicated tests for bbox coordinate matching

---

**Test 01 Conclusion:**
Integration successful, but quality and validation gaps identified. Test 02 required for comprehensive validation.
