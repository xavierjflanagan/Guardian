# Pass 0.5 Archive

**Purpose:** Historical reference to original implementation planning location

---

## Original Planning Location

Pass 0.5 implementation was originally planned and documented in:

**Location:** `shared/docs/architecture/database-foundation-v3/V3_Features_and_Concepts/shell-file-batching-and-encounter-discovery/`

**Contains:**
- ISSUE_ANALYSIS.md - Original problem analysis and design decisions
- archive/WORKER_FIXES_PLAN.md - Worker code fixes (Migration #35 and improvements)

**Migration Date:** October 30, 2025

---

## Why Migration Happened

To align Pass 0.5 documentation with Pass 1 and Pass 2 structure:
- Consistent folder organization across all passes
- Standard testing/audit folder structure
- Easier navigation for AI context loading
- Clearer integration between passes

## What Moved
