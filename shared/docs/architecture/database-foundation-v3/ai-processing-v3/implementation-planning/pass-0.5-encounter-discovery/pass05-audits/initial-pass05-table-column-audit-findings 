Few questions and feedback comments on certaincolumn outputs in tables for these pass 05 test resutls; 


pass05 encounter metrics table
- In the pass05 encounter metrics table, the "pages_per_encounter" column was correct for the 2 page tiff file as well as
  the previous single 13 page file, but for the frankenstein file it assigned each
  encounter as 10 pages each when it should have been 13 and 7 (the total_pages column
  correctly stated 20 pages) - so we need to investigate why it got it so wrong for the
  frankenstein file; manifest id = ab2b90d5-da79-4f21-9610-971e667731a9 . 
- Batching; 
   - manifest id b70f6cf2-73e1-4014-88cd-5265965c63af for 142 page pdf that was uploaded and analysed by pass 05. batching_required column was 1 for this, why? And batch_count was 1. 
  - where is the actual batching happening? the second key pillar of pass05 is to identify where batching should ideally happen. Obviously an ideal spot is inbetween two encounters. But batching is only needed if page count > x . 


Healthcare_encounters table
- This is not being updated at all really. there are so many empty columns in this table. Pass05 ai model is not producing the output to populate many o these columns that it could or should be doing. 
- for example 
    - healthcare encounter ID: 30bb946b-7f42-4db0-89ec-0bd186a65635
       - this is correctly labeled in tabel as a pseudo_lab_report but there is no encounter_date, facility_name, summary. 
       - the ai_extracted column is false - what does this mean? the requires_review is also false. Furthermore the condeince values for both those columns are null
       - the clinical_effective_date is null ?
       - spatial_bounds is empty []
       - encounter_date_end is null - should this be filled out if we know the encounter_date is a single date? ie it was just a blood test result on 1 day.
