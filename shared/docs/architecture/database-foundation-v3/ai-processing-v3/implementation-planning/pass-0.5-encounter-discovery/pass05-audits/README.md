# Pass 0.5 Database Audits

**Purpose:** Post-implementation audits of Pass 0.5 database tables for optimization opportunities

**Status:** Placeholder - audits pending test execution

---

## Audit Scope

Pass 0.5 writes to **4 database tables:**

1. **shell_file_manifests** - JSONB manifest storage
2. **healthcare_encounters** - Pre-created encounter records
3. **pass05_encounter_metrics** - Analytics and performance tracking
4. **shell_files** - Completion flag updates

---

## Planned Audits

### Audit 1: shell_file_manifests
**Focus:** JSONB structure validation, index performance, query patterns

**Key Questions:**
- Is manifest_data JSONB structure optimal for queries?
- Do we need GIN indexes on manifest_data?
- Are constraint violations occurring?
- Storage size analysis (JSONB compression effectiveness)

### Audit 2: healthcare_encounters
**Focus:** UPSERT performance, page_ranges normalization, constraint validation

**Key Questions:**
- Are UPSERT operations fast enough?
- Is page_ranges normalization working correctly?
- Any duplicate encounters created?
- Foreign key performance (patient_id, primary_shell_file_id)

### Audit 3: pass05_encounter_metrics
**Focus:** Metrics accuracy, planned vs pseudo separation

**Key Questions:**
- Are encounter counts accurate (real/planned/pseudo)?
- Token usage tracking correct?
- Cost calculation accuracy
- Processing time measurements valid

### Audit 4: shell_files
**Focus:** Completion flag reliability

**Key Questions:**
- Are completion flags set correctly?
- Any orphaned records (flag TRUE but no manifest)?
- Timestamp accuracy (pass_0_5_completed_at)

## Audit Methodology

Following Pass 1's proven approach:

1. **Column-by-column analysis** - Review each column for data quality
2. **Constraint validation** - Verify all database constraints enforced
3. **Query performance** - Analyze slow queries and missing indexes
4. **Data integrity** - Check for orphaned records, nulls, duplicates
5. **Optimization recommendations** - Propose schema improvements

## Current Status

**Audits Completed:** 0/4
**Issues Found:** 0
**Optimizations Applied:** 0

**Next Step:** Execute Test 01 before conducting audits
