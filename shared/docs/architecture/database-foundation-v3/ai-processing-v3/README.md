# AI Processing v3: Ground-Up Implementation

**Status:** Infrastructure Complete - AI Processing System Build Required
**Updated:** 26 September 2025 - Clean Slate Implementation Plan
**Current Reality:** Complete rebuild needed for AI processing logic
**Infrastructure:** V3 database + worker operational, AI processing missing entirely

---

## Current Infrastructure Status

### ✅ **OPERATIONAL: V3 Foundation**
- **V3 Database Schema:** 50+ tables deployed including enhanced clinical core, temporal data management, medical code resolution, and narrative architecture
- **Render.com Worker:** `exora-v3-worker` successfully polling jobs and claiming work
- **Edge Functions:** `shell-file-processor-v3` creating jobs from file uploads
- **Job Coordination:** Complete pipeline from upload → job queue → worker claiming
- **API Keys:** OpenAI and Google Vision configured in environment

### ❌ **MISSING: Complete AI Processing System**
- **No Bridge Schemas:** Deleted existing schemas - need ground-up creation aligned with current V3 database
- **No Pass Functions:** Pass 1, Pass 2, Pass 3 processing functions don't exist
- **No OpenAI Integration:** API calls not implemented in worker
- **No OCR Integration:** Google Cloud Vision not connected
- **No Clinical Data Extraction:** V3 database writes not implemented
- **Worker Simulation Only:** `processShellFile()` contains `sleep(2000)` placeholder

## What We're Building

### **Three-Pass AI Processing Architecture**
**Pass 1: Entity Detection**
- Classify document content into categories: `clinical_event`, `healthcare_context`, `document_structure`
- Lightweight AI model (GPT-4o-mini) for cost efficiency
- Output determines Pass 2 schema loading strategy

**Pass 2: Clinical Enrichment**
- Extract structured medical data using entity-specific bridge schemas
- High-accuracy AI model (GPT-4) for medical precision
- Write clinical data to V3 database tables
- System fully functional after Pass 2 completion

**Pass 3: Semantic Narratives**
- Create clinical storylines from structured Pass 2 data
- Generate meaningful medical narratives spanning document sections
- Optional enhancement layer - system works without Pass 3

### **Cost-Optimized Design**
- **Traditional approach:** ~$0.25 per document
- **Exora three-pass system:** ~$0.007 per document
- **85-90% cost reduction** through intelligent processing

## Clean Slate Implementation Approach

### **Phase 1: Bridge Schema System (Ground-Up)**
Create complete bridge schema coverage for V3 database structure:
- 27+ core processing tables need bridge schemas
- Three-tier system: `source` / `detailed` / `minimal` for token optimization
- Dynamic schema loading based on Pass 1 entity detection results
- Perfect alignment with deployed V3 database tables

### **Phase 2: Pass 1 Entity Detection (New Build)**
Build entity classification system from scratch:
- Single AI call to classify document entities
- 3-category taxonomy with processing priority
- Integration with bridge schema loading system

### **Phase 3: Pass 2 Clinical Enrichment (New Build)**
Build structured medical data extraction:
- Multiple AI calls based on Pass 1 entity categories
- Dynamic bridge schema application
- Clinical data writes to V3 database tables

### **Phase 4: Pass 3 Semantic Narratives (New Build)**
Build clinical storyline creation system:
- Process structured Pass 2 data (not raw text)
- Create meaningful medical narratives
- Link narratives to clinical data for rich UX

### **Phase 5: Integration & Testing**
End-to-end validation with real medical documents

## Key Architecture Documents

### **Pipeline Architecture**
- **[00-pipeline-overview.md](v3-pipeline-planning/00-pipeline-overview.md)** - Complete processing pipeline architecture
- **[07-semantic-document-architecture.md](v3-pipeline-planning/07-semantic-document-architecture.md)** - Shell file + clinical narratives design

### **Implementation Planning**
- **[CURRENT_STATE_AND_PLAN.md](CURRENT_STATE_AND_PLAN.md)** - Detailed implementation roadmap and current status

---

## Next Steps

**Priority 1:** Review detailed implementation plan in `CURRENT_STATE_AND_PLAN.md`
**Priority 2:** Begin Phase 1 bridge schema creation aligned with V3 database reality
**Priority 3:** Build Pass 1 entity detection system from scratch

**Worker Location:** `shared/docs/architecture/database-foundation-v3/current_workers/exora-v3-worker/src/worker.ts`
**Target Method:** `processShellFile()` - currently contains only simulation code
