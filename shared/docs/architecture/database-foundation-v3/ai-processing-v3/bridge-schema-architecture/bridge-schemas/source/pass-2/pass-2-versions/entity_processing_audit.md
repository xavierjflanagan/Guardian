# entity_processing_audit Bridge Schema (Source) - Pass 2 Version - PENDING RECREATION

**Status:** ðŸš§ Requires systematic recreation against database source of truth
**Database Source:** /current_schema/04_ai_processing.sql (entity_processing_audit table)
**Last Updated:** 30 September 2025
**Priority:** HIGH - Entity audit updates for Pass 2 clinical enrichment tracking

## Multi-Pass Context:
- This is the Pass 2 UPDATE version of entity_processing_audit
- Pass 1 version handles initial entity detection and audit record creation
- Pass 2 version updates clinical enrichment status and links to final clinical records
- Critical for maintaining complete audit trail from detection to clinical data

## Potential Issues:
- Complex UPDATE operation structure for existing audit records
- Missing UPDATE-specific fields for Pass 2 operations
- Clinical enrichment result linkage structure
- Data type mismatches for confidence and validation fields
- Missing database-specific fields for Pass 2 processing
- Schema population tracking and validation recording
- Error handling and retry logic structure

TODO: Recreate this schema by reading the actual database table structure from 04_ai_processing.sql and focusing on UPDATE operations for Pass 2 clinical enrichment
