# ai_confidence_scoring Bridge Schema (Source) - PENDING RECREATION

**Status:** ðŸš§ Requires systematic recreation against database source of truth
**Database Source:** /current_schema/04_ai_processing.sql (ai_confidence_scoring table)
**Last Updated:** 30 September 2025
**Priority:** HIGH - AI confidence metrics and scoring algorithms for quality assurance

## Potential Issues:
- Complex confidence calculation methodology tracking
- Missing required fields (entity_id, processing_session_id)
- Threshold management and comparison structure
- Data type mismatches for confidence score fields
- Missing database-specific fields for scoring management
- Cross-validation metrics structure
- Calibration and adjustment tracking

TODO: Recreate this schema by reading the actual database table structure from 04_ai_processing.sql
