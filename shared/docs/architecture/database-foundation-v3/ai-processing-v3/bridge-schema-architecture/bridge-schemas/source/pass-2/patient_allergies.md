**Status:** ðŸš§ Requires systematic recreation against database source of truth
**Database Source:** /current_schema/03_clinical_core.sql (patient_allergies table)
**Last Updated:** 30 September 2025
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Safety-critical allergy and adverse reaction records

## Potential Issues:
