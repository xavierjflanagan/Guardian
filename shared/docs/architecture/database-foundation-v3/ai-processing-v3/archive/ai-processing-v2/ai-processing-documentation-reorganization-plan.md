  # Guardian AI Processing Architecture

  **Enterprise Healthcare Document Processing Platform**

  ## Current Status

  ⚠️ **Critical Gap**: Current implementation is MVP-level. Enterprise requirements discovered:
  - Missing multi-profile support (self/child/adult_dependent/pet)
  - Missing O3's clinical events framework
  - Missing healthcare standards integration (SNOMED-CT/LOINC/CPT)
  - Missing spatial precision for document provenance

  See [CURRENT_STATUS.md](./CURRENT_STATUS.md) for gap analysis.

  ## Quick Navigation

  ### For Understanding Requirements
  - [Core Requirements](./01-core-requirements/) - What the system must do
  - [Clinical Classification](./02-clinical-classification/) - How we classify medical data

  ### For Implementation
  - [Implementation Roadmap](./IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) - 5-phase plan
  - [Extraction Pipeline](./03-extraction-pipeline/) - Document processing flow
  - [Technical Specifications](./06-technical-specifications/) - Developer reference

  ### For Compliance
  - [Healthcare Compliance](./04-healthcare-compliance/) - Regulatory requirements

  ## Priority Implementation

  ### Phase 1: Foundation (5-7 days) - BLOCKING
  1. Multi-profile document classification
  2. O3's two-axis clinical event framework
  3. Healthcare standards integration

  ### Phase 2: AI Processing (4-6 days)
  1. AI-first clinical fact extraction
  2. Timeline metadata generation
  3. Smart feature activation

  [Continue with phases...]

  Benefits of This Reorganization

  1. Clear Priority Path: Developers immediately see what's blocking database integration
  2. Conceptual Clarity: Separates "what" (requirements) from "how" (implementation)
  3. Enterprise Focus: Reflects actual healthcare platform needs, not MVP
  4. Future Ready: Includes provider portal preparation
  5. Clean Navigation: Logical progression from concepts to implementation

  Implementation Approach

  1. Step 1: Create new folder structure
  2. Step 2: Write critical blocking documentation first
  3. Step 3: Migrate valuable content from existing files
  4. Step 4: Archive deprecated MVP documentation
  5. Step 5: Update all cross-references and links

  This reorganization transforms the documentation from describing a basic MVP to accurately reflecting Guardian's enterprise healthcare platform
  requirements, with clear pathways for implementation.

  ## Critical Database Foundation Integration Points

  The AI processing pipeline MUST populate these database tables correctly:

  ### From database-foundation/core/schema.md:
  - **user_profiles** - Multi-profile support (self/child/adult_dependent/pet)
  - **smart_health_features** - Auto-activating UI features based on detected health data
  - **patient_clinical_events** - O3's two-axis classification (activity_type × clinical_purposes)
  - **patient_observations** - Detailed observation data from AI extraction
  - **patient_interventions** - Intervention details from AI extraction

  ### From database-foundation/features/healthcare-journey.md:
  - **healthcare_timeline_events** - Timeline metadata for every clinical fact
  - **healthcare_encounters** - Visit context extracted from documents
  - **profile_appointments** - Future appointments extracted from documents

  ### From database-foundation/implementation/sql/:
  - **clinical_fact_sources** - Provenance with PostGIS bounding boxes
  - **ai_processing_sessions** - Complete processing session tracking
  - **medical_data_relationships** - Relationships between clinical entities

  ### Key Integration Requirements:
  1. **Every AI extraction must map to patient_clinical_events** using O3's classification
  2. **Every clinical fact needs timeline metadata** for healthcare_timeline_events
  3. **Every extraction needs provenance tracking** in clinical_fact_sources
  4. **Profile classification must prevent contamination** across user_profiles
  5. **Smart features must auto-activate** based on detected content
