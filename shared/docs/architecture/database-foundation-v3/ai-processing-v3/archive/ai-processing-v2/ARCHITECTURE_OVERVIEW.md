## System Overview

Exora's AI Processing Architecture v2 is a complete redesign that transforms scattered healthcare file data into unified structured clinical data. Unlike the MVP v1 approach, this enterprise architecture directly aligns with Exora's database foundation.

### Core Design Principles

**Database-First Architecture**
- Single comprehensive AI call extracts and maps structured medical data directly to normalized database schema
- Ensures data consistency and enables advanced healthcare features

**Intelligent Document Format Processing**
- Smart routing system optimizes processing path for each document depending on file format.
- Fast path for 95% of clean documents (<500ms extraction)
- Rendering fallback option for complex formats ensures 99.5%+ success
- Learning system continuously improves routing decisions

**Multi-Profile Safety with Deferred Assignment**
- Complete medical processing occurs before profile assignment
- AI suggests profile ownership without automatic assignment
- User confirmation workflow prevents profile contamination
- Holding area for clinical data with unconfirmed user provenance

**Clinical Standards Compliance**
- Integration with SNOMED-CT, LOINC, and CPT coding systems
- Healthcare interoperability and provider integration ready
- Supports clinical decision support and analytics

**Single-Call AI Optimization**
- Comprehensive-AI-call processes complete medical analysis in single operation

## High-Level System Flow

### 1. Intelligent Document Routing
```
Medical Document → Format Analysis → Smart Routing → Optimized Processing
```
- Advanced format detection beyond simple MIME types
- Fast path for clean documents (95% of cases, <500ms)
- Rendering fallback for complex/problematic formats (<5% of cases)
- Learning system optimizes routing decisions from success patterns

### 2. Comprehensive-AI Processing
```
High-Quality Text → Single AI Call → Complete Medical Analysis
```
- Healthcare relevance validation with early termination
- Complete medical analysis: concepts, O3 classification, coding, timeline, features
- Profile ownership suggestion (without automatic assignment)
- Single call delivers all structured medical data

### 3. Profile Assignment Workflow
```
AI Suggestions → User Confirmation → Conditional Database Storage
```
- AI suggests profile ownership based on content analysis
- High confidence (>95%): Auto-assign to existing profiles
- Medium/Low confidence: User confirmation required
- Holding area prevents profile contamination

### 4. Conditional Database Population
```
Confirmed Data → Clinical Tables → Healthcare Timeline
```
- Database insertion only occurs after profile confirmation
- Complete audit trail with processing metrics
- Smart feature activation based on confirmed content
