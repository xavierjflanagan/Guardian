### V3_CORE_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
- **Archived**: 2025-08-28
- **Reason**: Phase 1 (Database Schema Deployment) completed successfully
- **Status**: 03_clinical_core.sql and 04_ai_processing.sql fully implemented with V3 architecture
- **Remaining Items**: Phase 2 and Phase 3 implementation items extracted and integrated into FRESH_START_BLUEPRINT.md
- **Replacement**: DATABASE_V3_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md now serves as master reference for table structures and relationships

### Archive Policy
Implementation plans are archived when:
1. Their primary objectives are completed
2. Remaining items are transferred to active roadmaps
3. They are superseded by better documentation
4. They serve as historical implementation records
