## Executive Summary

**Critical Finding:** 10-15% of expected document uploads will fail without comprehensive format support, representing a critical user experience gap that must be addressed before production launch.

**Key Insights:**
- **HEIC (iPhone photos) represents 5-8% of total upload volume** - Critical blocker for iPhone users
- **PDF dominates at 60-70% of uploads** - Multi-page handling essential
- **Office documents (DOCX/XLSX) contain 3-5% of clinical data** - Text extraction required to prevent data loss
- **Archive formats (ZIP) enable 2-3% of bulk uploads** - Workflow optimization opportunity

**Market Context:**
- iPhone dominates Australian market (65-70% share, projected 70-75% by 2026)
- 80%+ of iPhone users photograph documents vs scanning
- Healthcare documents increasingly distributed as Word/Excel files

## Critical Format Gaps - Risk Assessment

### 1. HEIC/HEIF Format (CRITICAL PRIORITY - P0)

**Business Impact:**
```yaml
risk_level: "CRITICAL"
user_volume: "5-8% of total uploads"
affected_users: "65-70% of Australian market (iPhone owners)"
failure_mode: "Complete processing failure"
user_experience_impact: "Upload rejection → App uninstall risk"
competitive_impact: "Massive disadvantage vs apps with HEIC support"
```

**Technical Requirements:**
```yaml
conversion_strategy: "HEIC → JPEG before OCR processing"
library_options:
  - "libheif (C++ library, requires native bindings)"
  - "Sharp library (Node.js - SUPPORTS HEIC NATIVELY)"
  - "heic-convert (npm package wrapper)"

recommended_approach: "Sharp library (already in use for TIFF)"
implementation_complexity: "LOW - Sharp handles HEIC out of box"
estimated_effort: "30-60 minutes (same pattern as TIFF)"
```

**User Workflow Example:**
```yaml
critical_use_case: "iPhone Camera Document Capture"
steps:
  1: "User opens Guardian app"
  2: "Taps 'Add Document' button"
  3: "App activates iPhone camera"
  4: "User photographs medical document"
  5: "iPhone saves as HEIC format (default)"
  6: "App uploads HEIC file"

current_failure: "Step 6 - Format rejection error"
impact: "Core feature completely broken for iPhone users"
solution: "Format processor converts HEIC → JPEG transparently"
```

### 2. PDF Multi-Page Handling (CRITICAL PRIORITY - P0)

**Business Impact:**
```yaml
risk_level: "CRITICAL"
user_volume: "60-70% of total uploads"
affected_documents: "Medical reports (5-200 pages), discharge summaries"
failure_mode: "Only first page processed → 93-99% data loss"
user_experience_impact: "Appears successful but clinical data missing"
compliance_impact: "Incomplete medical records, legal liability"
```

**Technical Requirements:**
```yaml
conversion_strategy: "Extract PDF pages → Convert to images → OCR each page"
library_options:
  - "pdf-lib (Pure JavaScript, manipulation)"
  - "pdfjs-dist (Mozilla PDF.js, battle-tested)"
  - "pdf2pic (Converts PDF pages to images - EXACT USE CASE)"
  - "pdf-poppler (Native wrapper, requires system dependencies)"

recommended_approach: "pdf2pic (designed for PDF → image conversion)"
implementation_complexity: "MEDIUM - Similar to TIFF pattern"
estimated_effort: "90-120 minutes"
```

**Data Loss Example:**
```yaml
scenario: "142-page Hospital Discharge Summary"
current_behavior:
  pages_processed: 1
  pages_lost: 141
  data_loss_percentage: "99.3%"

with_format_processor:
  pages_processed: 142
  pages_lost: 0
  data_loss_percentage: "0%"
```

### 3. Office Document Formats (HIGH PRIORITY - P1)

**Business Impact:**
```yaml
risk_level: "HIGH"
user_volume: "3-5% of total uploads"
affected_documents: "Provider medical reports (DOCX), lab results (XLSX)"
failure_mode: "Empty extractions, zero clinical data captured"
user_experience_impact: "Document appears processed but contains no data"
compliance_impact: "Missing clinical information, incomplete medical records"
```

**Technical Requirements:**
```yaml
conversion_strategy: "Text extraction → Feed to NLP pipeline"
library_options:
  docx:
    - "mammoth (Node.js, DOCX → HTML/text)"
    - "docx (Node.js, document parsing)"
    - "Apache POI (Java, full office suite)"
  xlsx:
    - "xlsx (SheetJS, comprehensive Excel support)"
    - "exceljs (Modern, async-friendly)"

recommended_approach:
  docx: "mammoth (simple text extraction)"
  xlsx: "xlsx (SheetJS - battle-tested)"

implementation_complexity: "MEDIUM-HIGH - Different pattern from image conversion"
estimated_effort: "2-3 hours (new architecture pattern)"
```

**Clinical Data Loss Example:**
```yaml
scenario: "GP Medical Report (DOCX - 8 pages)"
document_contains:
  - "Patient history and presenting complaint"
  - "Physical examination findings"
  - "Diagnosis and treatment plan"
  - "Medication prescriptions"
  - "Follow-up recommendations"

current_behavior: "Entire clinical narrative lost (OCR sees empty document)"
impact: "Zero medical information captured from provider report"
```

### 4. Archive Formats (MEDIUM PRIORITY - P2)

**Business Impact:**
```yaml
risk_level: "MEDIUM"
user_volume: "2-3% of total uploads"
affected_use_cases: "Bulk uploads, provider record packages"
failure_mode: "Single file rejection → Incomplete batch processing"
user_experience_impact: "Manual extraction required, workflow disruption"
workflow_impact: "Bulk upload scenarios completely broken"
```

**Technical Requirements:**
```yaml
conversion_strategy: "Extract archive → Process each file individually"
library_options:
  - "adm-zip (Pure JavaScript, ZIP support)"
  - "unzipper (Streaming unzip, memory-efficient)"
  - "node-unrar-js (RAR support, WASM-based)"

recommended_approach: "adm-zip for ZIP, evaluate RAR separately"
implementation_complexity: "MEDIUM - Recursive processing, resource management"
estimated_effort: "2-3 hours (includes security scanning)"
```

### 5. Modern Image Formats (LOW PRIORITY - P3)

**Business Impact:**
```yaml
risk_level: "LOW"
user_volume: "2-4% of total uploads"
affected_formats: "AVIF, JPEG-XL, animated WebP"
impact: "Future-proofing, modern device compatibility"
priority: "P3 - Future enhancement after core formats"
```

## User Workflow Impact Analysis

### Primary Use Case: iPhone Camera Document Capture

**Workflow Analysis:**
```yaml
user_journey:
  step_1:
    action: "User opens Guardian app"
    technical: "App initializes, checks authentication"

  step_2:
    action: "Taps 'Add Document' button"
    technical: "Document upload UI presented"

  step_3:
    action: "Selects 'Take Photo' option"
    technical: "iOS camera API activated"

  step_4:
    action: "Photographs medical document"
    technical: "iPhone captures in HEIC format (default since iOS 11)"

  step_5:
    action: "Reviews photo, confirms upload"
    technical: "App receives HEIC file from iOS photo picker"

  step_6_current_failure:
    action: "Upload processing begins"
    technical: "HEIC format rejected → Error shown to user"
    user_sees: "Unsupported file format error"
    user_reaction: "Confusion, frustration, app abandonment"

  step_6_with_format_processor:
    action: "Upload processing begins"
    technical: "Format processor: HEIC → JPEG → OCR → Success"
    user_sees: "Upload successful, processing in progress"
    user_reaction: "Seamless experience, continued app engagement"

current_failure_point: "Step 6 - HEIC format rejection"
business_impact: "Core feature completely broken for 65-70% of market"
solution_complexity: "LOW - Sharp library supports HEIC natively"
implementation_priority: "CRITICAL - Must fix before production launch"
```

### Secondary Use Case: Photo Library Bulk Scanning

**Workflow Analysis:**
```yaml
user_journey:
  step_1: "User grants photo library access"
  step_2: "App scans library for health-related photos (ML detection)"
  step_3: "App presents shortlist of potential medical documents"
  step_4: "User reviews and confirms relevant photos"
  step_5: "App initiates batch upload"

current_failure_point: "Step 5 - HEIC photos rejected in batch"
user_experience: "Some photos upload, others fail (confusing)"
impact: "Inconsistent bulk upload experience"
solution: "Batch HEIC processing with progress indication"
```

### Tertiary Use Case: Provider Record Downloads

**Workflow Analysis:**
```yaml
user_journey:
  step_1: "User receives medical records from healthcare provider"
  step_2: "Downloads ZIP archive or DOCX file"
  step_3: "Uploads to Guardian via browser"

current_failure_points:
  - "ZIP archives: Not unpacked, single file rejection"
  - "DOCX files: Empty extraction, no clinical data"

impact: "Provider-sourced documents unusable"
solution: "Archive unpacking + office document text extraction"
```
