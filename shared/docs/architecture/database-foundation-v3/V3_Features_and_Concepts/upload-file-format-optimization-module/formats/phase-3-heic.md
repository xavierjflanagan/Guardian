# Phase 3: HEIC/HEIF Support (iPhone Camera Photos)

## Implementation Status: COMPLETE

**Implementation Date:** November 1, 2025
**Deployment Status:** Live on Render.com (4th deployment attempt)
**Test Status:** PASSED (iPhone medication photo)

## Overview

Phase 3 adds HEIC/HEIF image format conversion for iPhone camera photo uploads. HEIC represents 5-8% of uploads but affects 65-70% of the Australian market (iPhone users). This was a critical blocker for the core use case: taking photos of medical documents with iPhone cameras.

## Technical Implementation

### Library Choice
**Selected:** `heic-convert@^2.1.0`
**Rationale:**
- Pure JavaScript implementation (no native dependencies)
- Works on Render.com without additional system packages
- Lightweight and fast
- Compatible with Node.js Buffer/ArrayBuffer APIs

**Alternative Considered:** Sharp with custom libvips build
**Rejected Because:** Requires native compilation, complex deployment

### Architecture

```typescript
// Inline conversion in format-processor/index.ts (Phase 3: HEIC/HEIF Support)
if (mimeType === 'image/heic' || mimeType === 'image/heif') {
  const heicBuffer = Buffer.from(base64Data, 'base64');

  const jpegArrayBuffer = await convert({
    buffer: new Uint8Array(heicBuffer) as unknown as ArrayBufferLike,
    format: 'JPEG',
    quality: config?.jpegQuality || 0.85,
  });

  const jpegBuffer = Buffer.from(jpegArrayBuffer);

  return {
    pages: [{ pageNumber: 1, base64: jpegBuffer.toString('base64'), ... }],
    totalPages: 1,
    conversionApplied: true,
  };
}
```

**Processing Pipeline:**
1. Decode base64 HEIC → Node.js Buffer
2. Convert Buffer → Uint8Array (required for heic-convert)
3. Convert HEIC → JPEG using heic-convert library
4. Wrap result → Node.js Buffer for base64 encoding
5. Return as single-page `ProcessedPage` for OCR pipeline

**Key Features:**
- Single-page format (HEIC files are single images)
- Inline conversion (no separate processor file needed)
- Configurable JPEG quality (default: 85%)
- Comprehensive error handling with correlation IDs
- Type-safe with proper TypeScript assertions

## Implementation Challenges

### Challenge 1: Deployment Failures (3 attempts)

#### Attempt 1: TypeScript Module Resolution
**Error:** `Could not find a declaration file for module 'heic-convert'`
**Root Cause:** `tsconfig.json` had restrictive `typeRoots: ["./node_modules/@types"]`
**Fix:** Removed typeRoots configuration
**Result:** FAILED (same error persisted)

#### Attempt 2: Dependency Classification
**Error:** Same TypeScript compilation error
**Root Cause:** `@types/heic-convert` in devDependencies (should be dependencies)
**Fix:** Moved `@types/heic-convert` from devDependencies → dependencies
**Rationale:** For deployed applications, build-time types must be in dependencies
**Result:** SUCCESS (deployment completed)

#### Attempt 3: Runtime Buffer Format Error
**Error:** `Spread syntax requires ...iterable[Symbol.iterator] to be a function`
**Root Cause:** Passed `heicBuffer.buffer` (ArrayBuffer - not iterable) to heic-convert
**Fix:** Convert to Uint8Array: `new Uint8Array(heicBuffer) as unknown as ArrayBufferLike`
**Rationale:** heic-convert uses spread operator internally, requires iterable data
**Result:** SUCCESS (HEIC conversion working in production)

### Key Learnings

1. **Build-time Dependencies in Deployed Apps**
   - Type definitions needed at build time belong in `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`
   - This differs from library packages where types can be in devDependencies
   - Render.com frozen-lockfile builds require strict dependency classification

2. **Type Definitions vs. Runtime Requirements**
   - Type definitions can be incorrect/outdated
   - heic-convert types say "ArrayBufferLike" but runtime requires iterable (Uint8Array)
   - Use type assertions when you know the runtime requirements better than the types

3. **Buffer vs. ArrayBuffer vs. Uint8Array**
   - Node.js Buffer: Convenient, has methods, wraps ArrayBuffer
   - ArrayBuffer: Raw memory, NOT iterable, can't use spread syntax
   - Uint8Array: Typed array, IS iterable, works with spread syntax
   - Conversion: `new Uint8Array(buffer)` creates view over buffer's ArrayBuffer

## Technical Details

### File Changes
- `apps/render-worker/package.json` - Added heic-convert + @types/heic-convert (dependencies)
- `apps/render-worker/src/utils/format-processor/index.ts` - Added HEIC conversion logic (lines 87-144)
- `apps/render-worker/tsconfig.json` - Removed restrictive typeRoots
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Updated for new dependencies

### Deployment History
1. **Attempt 1** (Commit: 9216259): BUILD FAILED - TypeScript module resolution
2. **Attempt 2** (Commit: 95b7f2c): BUILD FAILED - typeRoots didn't fully solve issue
3. **Attempt 3** (Commit: 177e019): BUILD SUCCESS - Moved types to dependencies
4. **Attempt 4** (Commit: 0f885a3): RUNTIME FIX - Buffer format corrected (Uint8Array)

### Dependencies
- **Runtime:** `heic-convert@^2.1.0`
- **Types:** `@types/heic-convert@^2.1.0` (in dependencies for build-time availability)
- **No system dependencies required**

## Known Limitations

1. **Dimensions Unknown:** heic-convert doesn't provide image dimensions (width/height returned as 0)
2. **Single-image Only:** Multi-image HEIC files not yet supported (requires `convert.all()`)
3. **No Metadata:** EXIF data, location, timestamp not extracted
4. **Memory Usage:** Entire image loaded into memory for conversion

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 3.1: HEIC Optimization (Future)
- Extract image dimensions using Sharp after conversion
- Support multi-image HEIC files (Live Photos, burst mode)
- EXIF metadata extraction (camera model, date, location)
- Progressive HEIC decoding for large images

### Phase 3.2: Advanced HEIC Features (Future)
- HEIF (HEVC video) support
- Alpha channel preservation (transparency)
- HDR image support
- Depth map extraction (Portrait mode photos)

## Recommendations

### Deployment
- Monitor HEIC conversion memory usage
- Track conversion times for optimization opportunities
- Consider caching converted JPEGs if same HEIC uploaded multiple times

### Testing
- Test with various iPhone models (different HEIC variants)
- Test with multi-image HEIC files (Live Photos)
- Test with very large HEIC files (48MP+ cameras)

### Monitoring
- Track HEIC conversion success rate
