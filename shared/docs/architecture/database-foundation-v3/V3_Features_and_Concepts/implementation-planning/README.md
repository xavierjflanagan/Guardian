# Implementation Planning

## Overview

This folder consolidates all concrete implementation steps, database changes, and development roadmaps needed to realize the V4 temporal data management system with medical code resolution and narrative architecture.

## Purpose

Translates conceptual designs from other folders into:
- Specific database schema migrations
- AI pipeline enhancement requirements
- Performance optimization targets
- Development phase breakdowns

## Key Files in This Folder

- **`v4-implementation-roadmap.md`** - Consolidated implementation plan with phases, timelines, and dependencies
- **`database-schema-migrations.md`** - Specific SQL changes needed for temporal tracking, medical codes, and narratives
- **`ai-pipeline-enhancements.md`** - Required modifications to Pass 1, Pass 2, and Pass 3 processing
- **`performance-optimization-targets.md`** - Response time goals, indexing strategies, and query patterns

## Implementation Scope

### Phase Overview
1. **Database Foundation**: Add temporal tracking fields and medical code columns
2. **Code Resolution**: Implement embedding-based medical code matching
3. **Narrative System**: Build hierarchical narrative architecture
4. **Integration**: Connect all components and optimize performance

### Critical Dependencies
- **V3 Infrastructure**: Building on existing three-pass AI pipeline
- **Medical Code Database**: Requires curated, embedded medical terminology
- **Frontend Updates**: UI changes for dual-lens navigation
- **Performance Validation**: Healthcare-grade response time requirements

## Relationships to Other Folders

- **Temporal Data Management**: Implements deduplication and supersession logic
- **Medical Code Resolution**: Deploys embedding-based code matching system
- **Narrative Architecture**: Builds dual-lens timeline/narrative interface

## Success Criteria

### Technical Targets
- Clinical decision support queries < 100ms
- Narrative creation processing < 600ms
- 95%+ medical code assignment accuracy
- Zero clinical data contamination across profiles

### Business Impact
- 85-90% cost reduction in AI processing
- Comprehensive audit trail for regulatory compliance
- Intuitive dual-lens user experience
- Healthcare-grade data safety and performance
