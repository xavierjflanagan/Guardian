# Database Schema Migrations

**Status**: Placeholder - To be fleshed out  
**Purpose**: Specific SQL migration scripts and database changes needed to support V4 temporal data management, medical coding, and narrative architecture

## File Contents (To Be Developed)

This file will contain:

### Temporal Tracking Field Additions
- SQL scripts for adding temporal fields to all clinical tables
- valid_from, valid_to, superseded_by_record_id column additions
- clinical_effective_date, date_confidence field implementation
- supersession_reason and is_current boolean field additions

### Medical Code Column Enhancements
- Multi-level medical code column additions (ingredient, SCD, SBD)
- Australian-specific code fields (PBS, MBS, SNOMED-AU)
- Clinical identity key generation and indexing
- Code confidence and source tracking fields

### Narrative Architecture Tables
- Clinical narratives table creation with versioning support
- Master narrative hierarchy table design
- Sub-narrative to master relationship junction tables
- Narrative linking tables for clinical entity connections

### Indexing Strategy Implementation
- Performance indexes for temporal queries
- Vector similarity indexes for embedding-based searches
- Composite indexes for clinical identity matching
- Partial indexes for current record filtering

### Constraint and Validation Rules
- Foreign key constraints for temporal relationships
- Check constraints for valid temporal ranges
- Unique constraints for clinical identity enforcement
- Validation rules for supersession chain integrity

### Migration Script Organization
- Sequential migration numbering and dependency management
- Rollback scripts for safe deployment
- Data validation and integrity checking
- Performance impact assessment and optimization

### Data Backfill Strategies
- Historical data temporal field population
- Medical code assignment for existing clinical entities
- Narrative creation for legacy clinical data
- Audit trail generation for migration activities

### Performance Optimization
- Index creation with minimal downtime
- Partitioning strategies for large tables
- Query optimization for new schema patterns
- Monitoring and alerting for migration progress

### Testing and Validation
- Schema migration testing procedures
- Data integrity validation scripts
- Performance regression testing
- Rollback testing and verification

### Production Deployment Strategy
- Staged migration approach for minimal service disruption
- Monitoring and alerting during migrations
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Post-migration validation and verification

This comprehensive migration plan ensures safe, efficient transformation of the V3 database to support all V4 temporal data management capabilities while maintaining data integrity and system performance.
