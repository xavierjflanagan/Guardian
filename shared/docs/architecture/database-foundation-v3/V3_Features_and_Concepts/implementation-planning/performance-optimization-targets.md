# Performance Optimization Targets

**Status**: Placeholder - To be fleshed out  
**Purpose**: Define response time goals, indexing strategies, and query patterns required to meet healthcare-grade performance requirements for V4 system

## File Contents (To Be Developed)

This file will contain:

### Healthcare-Grade Response Time Requirements
- Clinical decision support queries: < 50ms (drug allergy screening)
- Active medication review: < 100ms (care coordination)
- Surgical history analysis: < 500ms (comprehensive review)
- Timeline display queries: < 300ms (user interface)
- Narrative creation processing: < 600ms (Pass 3 semantic analysis)

### Database Query Optimization Strategies
- Specialized table indexing for life-critical queries
- Hub-and-spoke composite indexing for clinical analysis
- Vector similarity indexing for embedding-based operations
- Partial indexing for current record filtering (valid_to IS NULL)

### Caching Architecture Design
- Medical code resolution result caching
- Embedding similarity search result caching
- Narrative content caching for frequently accessed stories
- Clinical decision support rule caching

### Indexing Strategy Implementation
- Primary key optimization for all temporal tables
- Foreign key indexing for relationship queries
- Composite indexing for multi-field clinical identity matching
- Vector indexing (ivfflat, HNSW) for embedding similarity searches

### Query Pattern Optimization
- Current state queries (WHERE valid_to IS NULL)
- Historical state queries with temporal range filtering
- Cross-narrative relationship queries
- Clinical decision support pattern optimization

### Scalability Targets
- 10,000+ documents per day processing capability
- Concurrent user support for multi-profile healthcare families
- Real-time processing for urgent clinical decision support
- Batch processing efficiency for large document uploads

### Memory and Storage Optimization
- Embedding vector storage optimization
- Temporal data archive strategies
- Query result set size management
- Memory allocation for large clinical histories

### Monitoring and Alerting Framework
- Real-time performance metric collection
- Response time threshold alerting
- Query performance degradation detection
- Resource utilization monitoring and optimization

### Load Testing and Validation
- Stress testing procedures for peak usage scenarios
- Performance regression testing for schema changes
- Clinical workflow simulation for realistic load patterns
- Disaster recovery and failover performance validation

### Cost-Performance Balance
- AI processing cost optimization while maintaining accuracy
- Database resource allocation for optimal price-performance
- Caching strategies to reduce computational overhead
- Archive and compression strategies for historical data

### Australian Healthcare Compliance Performance
- Privacy Act compliance with performance requirements
- Audit trail creation without performance degradation
- Cross-border data handling performance considerations
- Regulatory reporting efficiency optimization

This optimization framework ensures that V4's sophisticated temporal data management and narrative capabilities meet the stringent performance requirements necessary for healthcare applications while maintaining cost efficiency and regulatory compliance.
