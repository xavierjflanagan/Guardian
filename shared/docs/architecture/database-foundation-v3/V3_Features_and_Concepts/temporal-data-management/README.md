# Temporal Data Management

**Status**: Production-Ready Implementation Specification  
**Created**: 11 September 2025  
**Last Updated**: 16 September 2025

## Overview

This folder contains the complete architecture for managing healthcare data across time, including deduplication, historical tracking, temporal conflict resolution, and global date format management. The system operates deterministically to ensure clinical safety while supporting Exora's international user base.

## Problem Domain

Healthcare data presents unique temporal challenges:
- Multiple documents may contain the same clinical information from different time periods
- Clinical entities (medications, conditions, allergies) evolve over time
- Document dates may conflict with clinical effective dates  
- International date formats create ambiguity (DD/MM vs MM/DD)
- Users need both current state and historical progression
- Concurrent document processing can create race conditions

## Key Concepts in This Folder

### Core Files

1. **`deduplication-framework.md`**
   - Deterministic supersession logic using medical codes and temporal precedence
   - Four supersession types: EXACT_DUPLICATE, PARAMETER_CHANGE, STATUS_CHANGE, TEMPORAL_ONLY
   - Concurrency safeguards and data integrity constraints
   - **Silver tables as source of truth** for user-facing clinical data

2. **`temporal-conflict-resolution.md`** 
   - Date hierarchy framework with 4-level precedence system
   - Integrates with Universal Date Format Management for normalized dates
   - Confidence propagation from format detection through dashboard display
   - Comprehensive tie-breaker logic for equal dates

3. **`clinical-identity-policies.md`** 
   - Identity determination logic separate from medical code assignment
   - Safety-critical rules preventing unsafe merging (route/form distinctions)
   - Conservative fallbacks for low-confidence scenarios
   - SNOMED CT hierarchy-based condition specificity

4. **`../universal-date-format-management.md`** 
   - Global date format detection supporting 20+ international formats
   - Document origin analysis for DD/MM vs MM/DD disambiguation  
   - User preference management with cultural format display
   - AI Pass 2 integration for format-aware date extraction

### Archive
- **`archive/`** - Contains all iterations of the temporal health data evolution strategy documents, preserving the evolution of our thinking

## System Architecture Flow

Raw File Upload → File Format Optimization Engine → OCR engine → Pass 1 AI entity classification → Step 1.5 (speific schema and medical code shortlist prepartion) → Pass 2 AI clinical entity enrichment (with Universal Date Format and Medical Code Assignment) → Clinical Identity Number Assigned → Deduplication/Supersession Engine Applied Determinsitically (Silver Tables) → Pass 3 AI Narratives Update/Generation → Dashboard Presentation


## Relationships to Other Folders

### **Upstream Dependencies**
- **`../medical-code-resolution/`**: Provides medical codes via embedding-based matching system at step 1.5, similarly and at the same time as all relevant schemas are pulled in prep for pass 2.
  - `embedding-based-code-matching.md` - Semantic search for code candidates
  - `code-hierarchy-selection.md` - RxNorm/PBS/SNOMED code assignment logic
  - `vague-medication-handling.md` - ATC codes for drug class mentions

### **Downstream Consumers**  
- **`../narrative-architecture/`**: Consumes deduplicated Silver tables for coherent clinical storylines
- **Dashboard Queries**: Direct access to current clinical state via optimized indexes
- **Historical Analysis**: Complete audit trail through supersession chains

### **Cross-Cutting Integrations**
- **`../implementation-planning/`**: Database migrations, performance optimization targets
- **AI Pass 2 Processing**: Enhanced date extraction with format awareness
- **User Profile System**: Cultural date format preferences and timezone handling

## Implementation Status

**✅ PRODUCTION READY** - All core components have been thoroughly reviewed and hardened.

### **Key Innovations Implemented**

#### **Deterministic Safety-First Design**
- **Zero AI decision-making** in critical deduplication logic
- **Medical code-based identity** with conservative fallbacks
- **Temporal precedence** using normalized clinical effective dates
- **Complete audit trail** preservation through supersession chains

#### **Global Healthcare Support**
- **Universal date format handling** for international documents (20+ formats)
- **Cultural date preferences** with user-configurable display formats
- **Document origin detection** to resolve DD/MM vs MM/DD ambiguity
- **Australian healthcare specificity** (PBS, MBS, SNOMED-AU)

#### **Production-Grade Operations**
- **Concurrency safeguards** with patient-level advisory locks
- **Data integrity constraints** preventing duplicate current records
- **Performance optimization** with materialized views and composite indexes
- **Race condition prevention** through idempotent processing

### **Clinical Safety Guarantees**
- ✅ **Zero unsafe medication merging** (route/form/strength distinctions)
- ✅ **Confidence propagation** from extraction through dashboard
- ✅ **Conservative fallbacks** for uncertain scenarios
- ✅ **Complete traceability** of all temporal decisions

### **Validation Status**
- ✅ **GPT-5 Security Review**: All critical issues addressed
- ✅ **Runtime Error Testing**: Async/scope/type bugs fixed
- ✅ **Clinical Safety Audit**: Medication merging safeguards verified
- ✅ **Performance Validation**: Scalable indexing strategy confirmed

### **Next Steps for Implementation**
1. Execute database migrations from `../implementation-planning/`
2. Integrate with AI Pass 2 processing pipeline
3. Deploy performance monitoring for deduplication processing times
4. Implement user preference UI for date format selection

The system is ready for production deployment with full clinical safety guarantees and international scalability.
