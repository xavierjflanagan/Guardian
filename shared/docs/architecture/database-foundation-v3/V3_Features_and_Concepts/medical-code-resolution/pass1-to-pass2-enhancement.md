# Pass 1 to Pass 2 Enhancement

**Status**: Placeholder - To be fleshed out  
**Purpose**: Define the integration points between Pass 1 entity extraction and Pass 2 enrichment through embedding-based medical code resolution

## File Contents (To Be Developed)

This file will contain:

### Enhanced Pass 1 Output Structure
- Structured attribute extraction instead of medical code generation
- Clinical entity categorization (medication, condition, allergy, procedure)
- Confidence scoring for extracted attributes
- Raw text preservation for embedding generation

### Embedding Layer Integration
- Workflow for embedding generation between passes
- Vector similarity search against medical code database
- Candidate code filtering and ranking algorithms
- Performance optimization for real-time processing

### Pass 2 Input Enhancement
- Enriched entity structure with candidate medical codes
- Context provision strategy for AI code selection
- Token budget management for multiple code candidates
- Fallback handling for low-confidence matches

### Processing Pipeline Modifications
- Integration points with existing three-pass architecture
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Logging and audit trail creation
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Code Selection Logic in Pass 2
- AI prompt engineering for medical code selection
- Confidence scoring for final code assignments
- Multi-code entity handling (combination therapies)
- Unknown or uncertain entity management

### Quality Assurance Integration
- Validation of Pass 1 attribute extraction accuracy
- Medical code assignment quality metrics
- Feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Edge case identification and handling

### Performance Considerations
- Latency targets for embedding lookup operations
- Caching strategies for common clinical entities
- Batch processing optimization for multiple entities
- Load balancing for high-volume processing

### Australian Healthcare Integration
- PBS/MBS code prioritization logic
- Local terminology preference handling
- Regulatory compliance validation
- Cross-border healthcare code management

This enhancement layer ensures seamless integration of embedding-based medical code resolution with the existing three-pass AI architecture while maintaining performance, accuracy, and compliance requirements.
