# Medical Code Database Design

**Status**: Placeholder - To be fleshed out  
**Purpose**: Define the database structure for storing and querying medical codes with embeddings for semantic matching

## File Contents (To Be Developed)

This file will contain:

### Database Schema Design
- Medical codes table with embedding vectors
- Multiple code system support (RxNorm, SNOMED, PBS, MBS, ICD-10)
- Search text optimization fields for embedding generation
- Synonym and variant tracking tables

### Vector Storage Architecture
- Embedding vector storage with appropriate dimensions
- Index strategies for vector similarity search (ivfflat, HNSW)
- Performance optimization for large-scale similarity queries
- Partitioning strategies for different entity types

### Code Hierarchy Representation
- RxNorm ingredient to SCD/SBD relationships
- SNOMED concept hierarchies and cross-references
- Australian-specific code mappings and equivalencies
- Version control for code system updates

### Data Population Strategy
- Import processes for standard medical terminologies
- Australian healthcare code integration workflows
- Embedding generation and storage procedures
- Quality validation and duplicate detection

### Query Optimization
- Similarity search performance targets
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed codes
- Batch processing capabilities for multiple entity resolution
- Load balancing for high-volume embedding queries

### Maintenance and Updates
- Quarterly terminology update procedures
- Embedding regeneration workflows
- Quality metrics and validation processes
- Archive and versioning strategies

### Integration Points
- Connection with Pass 1 entity extraction output
- Interface design for Pass 2 code selection
- Audit logging for code resolution decisions
- Fallback handling for unmatched entities

### Australian Healthcare Compliance
- PBS schedule integration and updates
- MBS item code relationship modeling
- SNOMED-AU specific variant handling
- Regulatory compliance audit capabilities

This database design ensures accurate, efficient, and compliant medical code resolution while supporting the embedding-based matching approach for optimal AI pipeline integration.
