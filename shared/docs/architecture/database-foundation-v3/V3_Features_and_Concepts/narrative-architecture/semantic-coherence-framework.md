# Semantic Coherence Framework

**Status**: Placeholder - To be fleshed out  
**Purpose**: Define the Pass 3 AI processing framework for creating semantically coherent clinical narratives from structured clinical events

## File Contents (To Be Developed)

This file will contain:

### Pass 3 Semantic Processing Architecture
- Processing structured JSON from Pass 2 (not raw text) for cost optimization
- Clinical storyline analysis and narrative coherence algorithms
- Semantic grouping of related clinical events across non-contiguous pages
- Shell file synthesis for overall document understanding

### Narrative Creation Workflow
- Input processing from Pass 2 structured clinical data
- Search-before-create logic for existing narrative matching
- Embedding-based narrative similarity detection
- Master narrative categorization and assignment

### Clinical Storyline Analysis
- Medical reasoning extraction from clinical event sequences
- Cause-effect relationship identification
- Treatment response pattern recognition
- Therapeutic decision context creation

### Semantic Grouping Algorithms
- Medical code-based event clustering
- Temporal relationship analysis for event sequences
- Clinical purpose alignment for coherent storylines
- Cross-document narrative continuation detection

### AI Context Management
- Hierarchical loading of relevant narrative context
- Token budget optimization for large patient histories
- Relevant subset selection based on medical codes and embeddings
- Batch processing strategies for complex clinical histories

### Quality Assurance Framework
- Semantic coherence scoring and validation
- Medical accuracy verification for generated narratives
- Clinical safety checking for narrative content
- Confidence scoring for narrative quality assessment

### Cost Optimization Strategies
- Structured JSON processing vs raw text analysis
- 85-95% cost reduction through intelligent data processing
- Embedding-based context filtering for efficiency
- Caching strategies for common clinical narrative patterns

### Integration with Narrative Architecture
- Master/sub-narrative hierarchy creation
- Timeline categorization integration
- Many-to-many relationship establishment
- Version history and supersession integration

### Australian Healthcare Context
- Local clinical terminology integration
- Australian healthcare workflow understanding
- Cultural and regulatory context awareness
- Provider and facility context preservation

### Performance and Scalability
- Response time targets for narrative generation
- Parallel processing capabilities for multiple narratives
- Load balancing for high-volume narrative creation
- Quality metrics and continuous improvement frameworks

This framework ensures that Pass 3 processing creates clinically meaningful, semantically coherent narratives that enhance user understanding while maintaining medical accuracy and cost efficiency.
