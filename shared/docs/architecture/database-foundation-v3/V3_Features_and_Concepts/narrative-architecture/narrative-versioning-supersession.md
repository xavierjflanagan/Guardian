# Narrative Versioning & Supersession

**Status**: Placeholder - To be fleshed out  
**Purpose**: Define how clinical narratives evolve over time through document uploads using the same supersession pattern as clinical entities

## File Contents (To Be Developed)

This file will contain:

### Unified Supersession Model
- Consistent supersession pattern for both clinical entities and narratives
- Clinical entities: superseded for deduplication (duplicates/updates)
- Narratives: superseded for evolution (incorporating new information)
- Same database patterns, queries, and mental model across all data types

### Narrative Evolution Through Supersession
- Each document upload creates new narrative versions (not in-place updates)
- Complete audit trail showing narrative progression over time
- Point-in-time narrative reconstruction capabilities
- Integration with shell file upload workflow

### Version History Management
- Narrative row structure with temporal tracking fields
- Previous version linking through supersession chains
- Shell file attribution for each narrative version
- Clinical date range updates as narratives evolve

### Cumulative Information Pattern
- Narratives accumulate information rather than replacing it
- Each version incorporates ALL previous knowledge PLUS new information
- Progressive enrichment of clinical understanding over time
- Graceful handling of contradictory information

### Database Schema Design
- Narrative versioning table structure
- Temporal tracking fields (valid_from, valid_to, superseded_by)
- Shell file relationship tracking
- Clinical date range calculation and storage

### Query Patterns for Narrative History
- Current narrative retrieval (valid_to IS NULL)
- Historical narrative state at specific dates
- Complete evolution timeline for narrative analysis
- Cross-narrative relationship tracking through versions

### Integration with Clinical Events
- Narrative version updates when underlying clinical events change
- Clinical event linking preservation across narrative versions
- Master narrative updating when sub-narratives evolve
- Many-to-many relationship versioning

### Performance Optimization
- Indexing strategies for temporal narrative queries
- Materialized views for current narrative state
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed narrative histories
- Archive strategies for old narrative versions

### User Experience Implications
- Frontend queries for current narrative content
- Historical view capabilities for narrative evolution
- Audit trail presentation for regulatory compliance
- Version comparison and diff functionality

### Quality Assurance and Safety
- Narrative evolution validation and quality checking
- Prevention of information loss during supersession
- Medical accuracy preservation across versions
- Conflict resolution for contradictory narrative updates

This versioning system ensures that clinical narratives maintain their richness and accuracy while providing complete auditability and the ability to understand how medical understanding has evolved over time.
