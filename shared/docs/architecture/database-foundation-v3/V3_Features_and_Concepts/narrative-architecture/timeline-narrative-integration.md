# Timeline-Narrative Integration

**Status**: Placeholder - To be fleshed out  
**Purpose**: Define the bi-directional navigation system between chronological timeline view and semantic narrative view for comprehensive healthcare data understanding

## File Contents (To Be Developed)

This file will contain:

### Dual-Lens Architecture Design
- Timeline view: Chronological "what happened when" with factual sequence
- Narrative view: Semantic "why this matters" with clinical reasoning
- Shared underlying clinical events data foundation
- Seamless switching between complementary perspectives

### Timeline View Enhancements
- Narrative badge integration showing which clinical stories events belong to
- Narrative filtering capabilities for focused timeline display
- Color coding and visual indicators for narrative-specific events
- Context preservation during filtered viewing

### Narrative View Enhancements
- Timeline tab integration within narrative stories
- Date range context display for narrative clinical spans
- Event linking with jump-to-timeline functionality
- Cross-navigation between related narrative journeys

### Bi-Directional Query Patterns
- Timeline events filtered by narrative relationship
- Narrative events displayed in chronological sequence
- Cross-referencing between timeline and narrative data
- Performance optimization for dual-view queries

### User Experience Workflows
- Timeline → Narrative navigation flow design
- Narrative → Timeline navigation flow design
- Bookmark and context switching capabilities
- Search functionality across both view types

### Data Relationship Modeling
- Clinical events as the shared foundation
- Narrative linking through clinical event relationships
- Timeline event grouping and narrative assignment
- Many-to-many relationship handling for complex medical situations

### Visual Design Integration
- Consistent iconography and color schemes across views
- Narrative-specific visual themes and identifiers
- Timeline marker integration with narrative context
- Responsive design for different device types

### Performance Considerations
- Query optimization for real-time view switching
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed narrative/timeline combinations
- Load balancing for high-volume user interactions
- Response time targets for seamless user experience

### Clinical Context Preservation
- Medical accuracy maintenance across view transitions
- Provider and facility context preservation
- Document provenance tracking in both views
- Audit trail creation for user navigation patterns

This integration system enables users to fluidly move between factual chronological understanding and meaningful clinical context, providing comprehensive insight into their healthcare journey.
