I'll scan the three documents now to provide precise architectural feedback with concrete, actionable recommendations.

[3 tools called]

Here‚Äôs my senior-review take, kept tight and actionable.

What‚Äôs strong
- Clear 3-layer split (backend ‚Üí translation ‚Üí display) with per-domain tables.
- Display tables as a UI cache, TTL/LRU, content hashing for staleness.
- Integration notes with temporal identity and code resolution.
- Complexity levels modeled in translation layer; fast toggling via display.

Key risks to address
- Write-on-read in DB functions: your PL/pgSQL examples enqueue jobs during SELECT. Under load this creates lock/contention and surprises. Move all queueing to the API layer; keep DB functions side-effect free.
- RLS and tenancy: explicitly add and index `patient_id`/`profile_id` on translation and display tables and enforce RLS on them. Your display tables show partition by `patient_id`, but ensure policies exist and queries always include tenant keys.
- Partitioning details: hash partitioning requires concrete child partitions; document the number/strategy (e.g., 16/32 by patient_id), plus vacuum/autovacuum settings.
- Expiration policy: let display rows expire; do not expire translation rows (keep history/audit). Replace `expires_at` on translations with `stale` via content_hash mismatch + `updated_at`.
- Hashing/versions: define per-domain ‚Äúcontent hash inputs‚Äù and a `hash_version` so you can evolve inputs without false-staleness.
- Queue semantics: add de-dupe keys, max attempts, backoff, dead-letter, and idempotency on workers. Budget/rate-limit AI calls.
- Confidence and safety: document thresholds per domain, human review queues for low confidence/Tier-2/3 languages, protected-terms/glossary enforcement.
- Long text: segment narratives (chunked translation + recomposition) to avoid timeouts and improve cache reuse.
- Language codes: standardize on BCP 47 (already looks aligned); validate at insert.
- Observability: define SLOs (hit rate, cold-start latency, stale ratio), metrics tables, and dashboards. Add per-user preload tier tracking if doing personalization.

Concrete adjustments I‚Äôd make to the docs
- Multi-language architecture:
  - Remove queue-enqueue examples from `get_*` SQL functions; show API-route flow that enqueues jobs and returns fallback.
  - Add RLS policy examples for `*_translations` and `*_display` with tenant keys.
  - Remove `expires_at` from translation tables; keep it on display tables only.
  - Specify partition count and child creation for `*_display`.
  - Add queue table uniqueness on `(entity_type, entity_id, target_language, complexity_level, op)`.
- Medical-literacy levels:
  - Call out protected terms/glossary and confidence thresholds before simplified text is shown by default.
  - Note human-in-the-loop review path and override behavior in display tables.
- README:
  - Add an ‚ÄúOperational SLOs & Metrics‚Äù section (hit rate targets, cold-start bounds, cost budgets).
  - Add ‚ÄúInfra mapping‚Äù (Vercel = API/read path, Supabase = DB/RLS/queue, Render = workers) and ‚ÄúNo side effects in DB read functions‚Äù principle.

Answering your implied UX concerns
- Normal path: frontend hits display tables only; sub-5‚Äì50 ms.
- First-hit warm-up: 50‚Äì150 ms if translation exists; otherwise session translation instantly + background processing (1‚Äì3 s for short fields), then cached.
- Preload strategy: preload above-the-fold + both complexity levels; personalize preloading by user behavior; demote low-value preloads via effectiveness metrics.

If you want, I can apply these doc edits now (no code changes), focusing on: removing write-on-read examples, adding RLS policies, queue semantics, and the partitioning/observability sections.

4. Healthcare safety (confidence thresholds)





GPT5 response:
I'll open that review file now and give you a concise verdict with any corrections or additions.

[1 tool called]

I opened and reviewed the Claude response; here‚Äôs my concise verdict and what to add next.

- Agree: Their validations of the key risks are correct (no write-on-read, enforce RLS/tenant keys, specify partitioning, don‚Äôt expire translations, queue semantics, confidence thresholds, observability).
- Add these (good catches): migration plan for existing data, rollback/disable plan, cost modeling/budget controls, and integration/end-to-end testing of eventual consistency.
- On long-text segmentation: defer for v1; enable only for narratives over a size threshold and behind a flag. If/when used: sentence-boundary chunks (~800‚Äì1200 chars), segment checksums for reuse, and recomposition tests.

What I‚Äôd update in the docs (short list)
- multi-language-architecture.md:
  - Remove any enqueue-on-SELECT examples; queue only in API.
  - Add RLS policies with explicit `patient_id/profile_id` on translation/display tables.
  - Drop `expires_at` from translations; keep TTL/LRU only on display.
  - Specify partition count and child tables; add index strategy and autovacuum notes.
  - Queue semantics: unique key, retries/backoff, dead-letter, idempotency, per-tenant rate limits/budgets.
- medical-literacy-levels.md:
  - Protected-terms/glossary rules; per-domain confidence thresholds; human-review queue; override handling.
- README:
  - Infra mapping (Vercel=API, Supabase=DB/RLS/queue, Render=workers), SLOs (hit rate, cold-start), and cost guardrails.
  - New sections: Migration (backfill + hashes), Rollback (feature flags + read-only mode), Test plan (fixtures, race conditions, staleness).

Optional additions (brief)
- Privacy/analytics: ensure session recording and ‚Äúviewed‚Äù metrics are PHI-safe/redacted.
- Backfill strategy: prioritize active users, then trickle to long tail; track progress and cost.

If you want, I can apply these doc edits now in those three files without touching code.
