# Health Data Universality

**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Created**: 16 September 2025  
**Last Updated**: 16 September 2025

## Overview

This folder addresses the critical need for making healthcare information accessible across language barriers and medical literacy levels using a three-layer database architecture. The system provides two orthogonal capabilities that can be combined: multi-language translation and medical complexity adjustment, ensuring every user can understand their health information regardless of their linguistic background or medical knowledge level.

## Problem Domain

Healthcare information accessibility presents unique challenges:
- International users need healthcare information in their native/desired language
- Medical terminology creates barriers for patients without medical training
- Healthcare providers require full medical detail while patients need simplified explanations
- Translation accuracy is critical for medical safety
- Premium features need proper access control and feature flagging
- Language availability depends on AI model capabilities and may expand over time

## Core Capabilities

### **1. Multi-Language Translation**
Complete healthcare profile translation supporting international users, travelers, and native language preferences using a three-layer architecture:
- **Backend Tables**: Existing clinical tables (patient_medications, patient_conditions, etc.) store source language data
- **Translation Tables**: Per-domain tables (medication_translations, condition_translations, etc.) store AI translations with confidence scores
- **Display Tables**: Per-domain UI cache (medications_display, conditions_display, etc.) for sub-5ms dashboard performance

Hybrid approach supports both planned languages (2-5 minutes background processing) and emergency translation scenarios (10-30 seconds frontend fallback).

### **2. Medical Literacy Levels**
Two-tier complexity system integrated into the translation layer, allowing users to toggle between medical jargon and patient-friendly language. Each translation table includes complexity_level columns ('medical_jargon', 'simplified') targeting 14-year-old reading comprehension for simplified versions. Healthcare providers default to medical terminology with "Patient View" toggle capability.

## Key Files Planning

### **Core Architecture Files**

#### **`multi-language-architecture.md`**
**Focus**: Three-layer database architecture for optimal translation performance
- Per-domain table architecture: backend tables (unchanged) + translation tables + display tables
- Backend tables (patient_medications, patient_conditions, etc.) remain source of truth with minimal additions
- Translation tables (medication_translations, condition_translations, etc.) store normalized translations per clinical domain
- Display tables (medications_display, conditions_display, etc.) provide lazily-populated UI cache with partitioning
- Content fingerprinting and staleness detection for efficient sync between layers
- Translation workflow: AI translation → translation tables → display table population
- Foreign language file upload: three-step process through all layers with proper deduplication
- TTL/LRU expiry mechanisms for unused translations and automatic cleanup

#### **`medical-literacy-levels.md`**
**Focus**: Complexity-aware three-layer architecture implementation
- Backend tables store medical jargon as source of truth, simplified versions in translation layer
- Per-domain translation tables include complexity_level column ('medical_jargon', 'simplified')
- Display tables support fast complexity toggling with pre-populated variants
- Query functions use display tables first with fallbacks to translation tables then backend tables
- Medical terminology simplification database with automated reading level validation
- Healthcare provider "Patient View" functionality integrated with display table lookups
- Complexity-aware dashboard queries optimized for sub-5ms performance
- Session-based complexity overrides for healthcare providers viewing patient perspectives

- Dynamic language availability based on AI model capabilities and translation table coverage
- Quality assessment includes translation coverage across per-domain tables (medication_translations, condition_translations, etc.)
- Display table population triggers for languages with low coverage
- Language selection triggers background translation sync queue jobs for user's clinical entities
- Three-layer fallback strategies: display tables → translation tables → backend tables → language hierarchy
- User language addition automatically queues translation jobs for existing clinical data

#### **`translation-quality-assurance.md`**
**Focus**: Per-domain confidence tracking and quality assurance
- Confidence scores integrated directly into per-domain translation tables
- Quality metrics table linking to specific translation records across domains
- Display table quality indicators for fast UI confidence display
- Error handling with per-domain table fallback chains
- Translation quality monitoring across medication_translations, condition_translations, etc.
- User feedback collection linked to specific translation table records

#### **`user-experience-flows.md`**
**Focus**: Three-layer architecture user experience optimization
- Language switching with display table existence checks and translation sync queue triggers
- Fast dashboard queries using display tables with automatic translation table fallbacks
- Emergency translation sessions with cost estimation based on backend table entity counts
- Shared profile creation with display table population for target language/complexity
- Foreign language document processing through three-layer integration workflow
- Premium subscription flows with translation coverage monitoring
- Healthcare provider patient view using display table complexity variants

### **Supporting Architecture Files**

#### **`feature-flag-integration.md`**
**Focus**: Access control and subscription tier management
- Feature flag architecture for language support (language translation only available to premium subscription tiers)
- Medical literacy features available across all subscription tiers
- Language translation paywall implementation
- Subscription upgrade prompts for language translation features

- Per-domain translation tables integrated with supersession logic and temporal data management
- Display tables enhance silver table concept with UI-optimized caching layer
- Migration strategy: add translation/display tables → populate → update application queries
- Sync queue architecture for propagating changes between layers
- Content hash-based staleness detection and automatic display table updates

#### **`business-model-integration.md`**
**Focus**: Commercial strategy and international expansion
- Freemium language support model (primary language free, additional languages premium)
- Initial 'X days' free trial to experience language translation features (all users at sign up provided with premium subscrition tier trial, enabling language translation features, but maybe only one additional language during free trial)
- International market expansion strategy using translation capabilities
- Cost analysis and pricing strategy for language support
- Target market analysis for different language communities
- Revenue projection from translation feature adoption

## System Architecture Integration
