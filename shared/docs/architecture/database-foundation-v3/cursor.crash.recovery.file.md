Perfect! Now I have the full picture. You're absolutely right about the documentation structure. Let me
  create a clear summary:

  ✅ Confirmed Understanding:



   Documentation Structure:

  shared/docs/architecture/database-foundation-v3/

  Actual Implementation (Source of Truth):

  🎯 Updated Understanding Based on Docs:

  Current Architecture (V3 - August 2025):

  Upload Flow Intention:
  1. Upload file → Supabase Storage
  2. Call shell-file-processor-v3 Edge Function
  3. Edge Function creates:
     - shell_files record
     - job_queue with job_type='shell_file_processing'
  4. Worker claims job
  5. Worker does: Download → OCR → AI Analysis → Update status

  Current Reality (What I Found):
  ✅ Steps 1-3 working (Edge Function creates job)
  ❌ Step 5 is TODO stub (worker doesn't actually process)

  📝 Critical Gaps Identified:

  From Worker Architecture Doc:

  Remaining TODO:
  - Add actual OpenAI integration for document analysis
  - Add Google Cloud Vision for OCR
  - Implement file download from Supabase Storage

  This confirms what I found - the worker has no actual processing logic yet!

  What This Means for Pass 1:

  The original plan was:
  shell_file_processing job → OCR + AI analysis

  But you've now designed Pass 1 as a separate, more sophisticated system:
  pass1_entity_detection job → GPT-4o Vision + OCR cross-validation → 7 database tables

  So the shell_file_processing job type is essentially obsolete - it was a placeholder for what Pass 1 now
  does properly.

  🔧 What Needs to Happen:

  You need to replace the old intended flow with the new Pass 1 flow:

  OLD (planned but never implemented):
  Upload → shell_file_processing → (TODO: OCR + basic AI)

  NEW (Pass 1 architecture):
  Upload → pass1_entity_detection → (Complete: Vision AI + OCR + 7 tables)

  Ready to continue with Phase 4.2 (Render.com status check)? Or should we first decide whether to:
  - A) Replace shell_file_processing with pass1_entity_detection
  - B) Keep both and make Pass 1 a separate step

  What do you think?

  Todos
  ☒ Phase 4.1: Investigate current upload flow and job types
  ☐ Phase 4.2: Check Render.com worker status and environment variables
  ☐ Phase 4.3: Verify all 7 Pass 1 database tables exist
  ☐ Phase 4.4: Verify job queue functions and Pass 1 job type support
  ☐ Phase 5: Add OCR integration if missing
  ☐ Phase 6: Update upload flow to create Pass 1 jobs
  ☐ Phase 7: Run first manual Pass 1 test
  ☐ Phase 8: Run first real upload end-to-end test
