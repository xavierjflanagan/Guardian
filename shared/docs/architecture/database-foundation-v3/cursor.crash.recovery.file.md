     # Test 05: Gold Standard Prompt - Variability Analysis
     **Date:** 2025-10-07
     **Purpose:** Analyze consistency and variability across 4 successful test runs with GPT-5-mini + gold standard
     prompt
     **Document:** Patient Health Summary (same file uploaded 4 times)
     **Configuration:** Gold Standard prompt (348 lines) with constraint hardening (post Run 3 fix)
     ## Executive Summary
     **Overall Consistency: GOOD (89% entity count stability)**

⏺ Perfect! I've created an accurate Test 05 variability analysis based on real database queries from
  pass1_entity_metrics and entity_processing_audit tables.

  Key findings from the ACTUAL data:

  1. Entity counts (from database, not job_result JSON):
    - Run 1: 47 entities
    - Run 2: 39 entities
    - Run 4: 35 entities
    - Run 5: 40 entities
  2. Healthcare context bifurcation:
    - Runs 1&2: 20 healthcare_context entities (granular pattern)
    - Runs 4&5: 9 healthcare_context entities (consolidated pattern)
    - 100% consistency WITHIN each pattern
  3. 100% clinical data capture:
    - All 9 immunizations detected in every run
    - All patient demographics captured
    - 97% average confidence, 97% OCR agreement
  4. The job_result JSON summaries were incorrect - the database is the source of truth.

  Should I commit this corrected analysis?

> 1. given all the context youve recently ingested on how pass 1 and pass 2 works and the interlinking relationship 
between them; its clear that we want to reduce token output (and subsequently cost) and i notice from your 
variability analysis dile that runs 4 and 5 were cheaper and had fewer output tokens most likely due to the fact that
 they ahd fewer output entities because of the fact that they were doing less 'entity splitting'. So my main question
 here is, should we optimize for reduced entity splitting like in runs 4 and 5 and optimize the prompt constraints to
 lean towards this strategy? For example even in run 5 (the latest run) in some scenarios it seperated hte 
immunizaiton date from the immunization and created two seperate entities rather than an efficinet single entity.    
   2. I also want to take this time to analyse all the columns of all the tables that are being filled by the ai 
output to determine what is neccessary: for example, processing_priority and pass2_status are obviously important but
 pass2_status is just a simple inference on the former column so is AI wasting tokens producing the data point for 
pass2_status? and furthermore are we wasting input tokens in the prompt by telling it how to fill out this columna nd
 make these inferences?   Also as another example; pass1_token_usage and pass1_image_tokens have the same values for 
every row/entity in the file - and i suspect the value it is inputting fo every individual entity is actually the 
toal token usage for the entire shell_file ai processing... hence i dont think we need these two columns for 
individual entities, especially if it is saoking up output tokens and increasing our costs (and same goes for 
pass1_cost_estimate). In general i think i want us both to go through every column in every pass 1 outut table and 
decide what can stay and what is working and what isnt etc. 

⏺ Excellent analysis! You're absolutely right on both counts. Let me address these systematically:

  1. Entity Splitting Optimization Analysis

⏺ supabase - Execute SQL (MCP)(query: "\n-- Compare token usage and costs between high-split (Runs 1&2) vs low-split
                              (Runs 4&5) runs\nSELECT \n  CASE \n    WHEN processing_session_id IN
                              ('c33140db-8539-474c-bf54-46d66b6048bf', '5f455b06-3ff8-46d0-b320-c9bf469b9f80') \n
                              THEN 'High Split (Runs 1&2)'\n    ELSE 'Low Split (Runs 4&5)'\n  END as split_pattern,\n
                              ROUND(AVG(entities_detected), 1) as avg_entities,\n  ROUND(AVG(cost_usd::numeric), 3) as
                              avg_cost,\n  ROUND(AVG(cost_usd::numeric / NULLIF(entities_detected, 0)), 4) as
                              cost_per_entity,\n  COUNT(*) as sample_size\nFROM pass1_entity_metrics\nWHERE

⏺ Cost Analysis:
  - High Split (Runs 1&2): 43 entities avg, $0.214 avg cost = $0.0050/entity
  - Low Split (Runs 4&5): 37.5 entities avg, $0.191 avg cost = $0.0051/entity

  Surprising finding: Cost per entity is nearly identical! The total cost reduction ($0.214 → $0.191 = 11% savings)
  comes from fewer entities, but the per-entity cost is the same. This suggests the AI output token cost is
  proportional to entity count, not entity complexity.

  Recommendation for Entity Splitting: ✅ YES, optimize for consolidated entities

  Why:
  1. 11% cost savings ($0.023/document × 10,000 docs = $230/month saved)
  2. Simpler Pass 2 processing - fewer entities to enrich
  3. Same information captured - zero data loss in consolidated pattern
  4. More efficient database - fewer rows in entity_processing_audit

  Prompt changes needed:
  // Add to CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS section (after line 112):
  8. ENTITY CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY:
     - Combine labels with their values in a single entity ("Name: Xavier Flanagan" not "Name:" + "Xavier Flanagan")
     - Keep multi-component items together ("Boostrix (Pertussis, Diphtheria, Tetanus)" as 1 entity)
     - Consolidate related address lines ("505 Grasslands Rd, Boneo 3939" as 1 entity)
     - Only split when medically necessary (separate clinical events, different dates)

  2. Column Necessity Analysis

  Let me check what columns are actually being filled by the AI vs computed by code:

⏺ YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT!

  All 40 entities have:
  - Same pass1_token_usage: 21,333 tokens (1 unique value)
  - Same pass1_image_tokens: (1 unique value)
  - Same pass1_cost_estimate: $0.1976 (1 unique value)

  These are shell_file-level metrics duplicated 40 times! Let me check the code to see where these are being set and
  if the AI is generating them:

⏺ Search(pattern: "pass1_token_usage|pass1_cost_estimate|processing_priority|pass2_status", path:
        "apps/render-worker/src/pass1")

⏺ Perfect! Now I can see the issue. The code is taking the session-level token/cost data from the AI response and
  copying it to every entity record. Let me check processing_priority and pass2_status:

⏺ Search(pattern: "processing_priority.*=|pass2_status.*=", path: "apps/render-worker/src/pass1/pass1-translation.ts",
        output_mode: "content")
