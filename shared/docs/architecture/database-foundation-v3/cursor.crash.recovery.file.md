1. i think we should take this time to thoroughly review claude memory file to amke sure its alla 
ccurate and up to date and refelcts exactly what it needs to. We should review each section line by 
line, asking me question or reviewing the codebase, database schemas, functions, external 
aplpications etc that are currently the current state of operaitons and source of truth (as i dont 
want claude being misinformed every hour of every day). Please start on this. 

⏺ Excellent idea! Let's do a comprehensive line-by-line review of CLAUDE.md to ensure it's accurate
  and reflects the current state of the codebase. I'll work through each section systematically.

⏺ Read(CLAUDE.md)
  ⎿  Read 364 lines

⏺ Perfect! Now let me verify key facts by checking the actual codebase. I'll create a systematic
  review checklist and verify each section:

⏺ Let me start the comprehensive review. I'll go section by section with specific verification
  questions:

  ---
  CLAUDE.md Comprehensive Review

  Section 1: Project Overview (Lines 5-11)

  Current text:
  **Exora** (by Exora Health Pty Ltd) is an AI-powered healthcare application designed to help users
  aggregate, manage, and understand their medical records. It's a patient-owned healthcare data
  platform built with Next.js, Supabase, Render.com, Vercel and TypeScript.

  **Company:** Exora Health Pty Ltd (Australian company)
  **Primary Domain:** exorahealth.com.au
  **Status:** Still building out the product, currently designing the ai processing component of the
  pipeline to perfectly fit the database table format.

  Verification:
  - ✅ Next.js 15.3.4 confirmed
  - ✅ React 19 confirmed
  - ✅ PNPM 9.15.1 confirmed
  - ✅ Monorepo structure confirmed (apps/web, apps/render-worker, packages/*)

  QUESTIONS FOR YOU:

  1. Status line: Is "currently designing the ai processing component of the pipeline to perfectly
  fit the database table format" still accurate? Or have you moved beyond design into
  implementation/testing?
  2. Domain: Is exorahealth.com.au actually live and configured, or is it still in "transfer to
  company pending" status as mentioned in line 303?
  3. Product name: The app is called "Exora" but the codebase is "Guardian". Should CLAUDE.md clarify
   this? (e.g., "Exora (codenamed Guardian internally)")

  ---
  Section 2: Development Commands (Lines 13-36)

  Current text shows:
  pnpm --filter @guardian/web run dev
  pnpm --filter @guardian/web run build

  Verification needed:
  - The monorepo has apps/web/ directory confirmed
  - But does apps/web/package.json actually define "name": "@guardian/web"?

  QUESTION FOR YOU:

  4. Package naming: What is the actual package name in apps/web/package.json? Should these commands
  use a different filter?

  ---
  Section 3: V3 Background Processing Architecture (Lines 70-76)

  Current text:
  **Render.com Worker Service:** `exora-v3-worker`
  - **Staging Deployment**: `staging` branch → Render.com with enhanced debugging
  - **Production Deployment**: `main` branch → Render.com with production optimization

  QUESTIONS FOR YOU:

  5. Render service name: Is the actual Render.com service called exora-v3-worker? (I couldn't verify
   because no workspace is set in Render MCP)
  6. Branch deployment: Are both staging and main branches actually auto-deploying to Render.com? Or
  is it manual?
  7. Worker location: The worker code is in apps/render-worker/ - is this the complete V3 processing
  pipeline, or are there other components?

  ---
  Section 4: Core Systems - Document Processing (Lines 111-115)

  Current text:
  #### 3. Document Processing Pipeline
  - **Edge Function**: `supabase/functions/document-processor/`
  - Deno runtime with TypeScript support
  - Status tracking: uploaded → processing → completed
  - Ready for OCR and AI integration

  Verification:
  - I see supabase/functions/ contains: audit-logger-v3, auto-provision-user-profile,
  shell-file-processor-v3
  - There's NO document-processor/ directory

  QUESTIONS FOR YOU:

  8. Edge Functions: Should this section be updated to reflect the actual functions?
  (shell-file-processor-v3, audit-logger-v3, auto-provision-user-profile)
  9. Processing location: Is document processing happening in the Render.com worker
  (apps/render-worker) or in Supabase Edge Functions or both?
  10. "Ready for OCR and AI integration": This sounds outdated. Haven't you already implemented
  Vision + OCR processing?

  ---
  Section 5: Document Processing Pipeline (Lines 306-337)

  Current text mentions:
  # New AI Processing APIs
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key          # For GPT-4o Mini vision analysis
  GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_google_api_key    # For Google Cloud Vision OCR

  QUESTIONS FOR YOU:

  11. Google Cloud Vision: Are you actually using Google Cloud Vision OCR, or was that replaced by
  something else?
  12. API Endpoints: Line 336 says POST /functions/v1/document-processor but I don't see that
  function. What's the actual endpoint for processing documents?

  ---
  Section 6: AI Processing Pipeline Development Plan (Lines 339-364)

  Current text:
  **Current Priority**: Schema Research & AI Integration Strategy
  **Problem Identified**: The two-call AI architecture approach needs precise database schema
  understanding...
  **Current Status**: Pipeline architecture documented in
  `shared/docs/architecture/ai-processing-v2/draft-ai-processing-pipeline-flow.md` - parked pending
  schema research completion.

  QUESTIONS FOR YOU:

  13. Current priority: Is this still accurate? Or have you moved past this phase given all the
  bridge schemas and pass1/pass2/pass3 work we've been doing?
  14. Should this entire section be replaced with current V3 architecture status (Pass 1 entity
  detection, Pass 2 clinical extraction, Pass 3 narrative, etc.)?

  ---
  Shall I continue with more specific checks, or would you like to answer these 14 questions first so
   I can update CLAUDE.md accurately?

> 1. still accurate.  2. no changes needed.   3. The app is called "Exora" - guardian was the old 
name but i could acquire domain / virtual realestate for guardian, so we're not really using that 
anymore because we registered company as exora and bought domains as exora etc.     4. I have no idea
 what you mean by " 4. Package naming: What is the actual package name in apps/web/package.json? 
Should these commands
  use a different filter?" ??    5. im not sure what the current render service is called bu i think 
its just "Exora Health" as per what i can see on the render.com website portal: [Image #1]      6. we
 initially were working off staging branch as that seemeed smart and what enigneers do (im not an 
engineer), but there were too many annoying bugs with signing up as atest user and the magic link 
email redirecting to main etc. so i just switched everything back to main branch and production 
website. so it now should all be configured to main and prod. which it has been for last week with no
 issues.         7. the worker code is in apps/render-worker but we also have some docs files in 
shared/docs/architecture/database-foundation-v3/current_workers - not sure if thats relevant please 
investigate - maybe we need to tidy this docs folder.   Also, OCR is currently performed in supabase 
atm but i beleive we have a plan to move it to a worker function inside render.com, but we havent 
dont this yet.        8. These are the current supabase edge dunctions we have a sper supabase: "Name
