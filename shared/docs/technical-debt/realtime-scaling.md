# Realtime Scaling

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Performance with large patient lists  
**Effort:** 2-3 hours (architecture + implementation + testing)  
**Risk:** Subscription performance degradation, connection instability  
**Trigger:** 50+ patients per user  

## Current State

- ✅ **Single realtime channel working** for document and timeline updates
- ✅ **Patient-based filtering** implemented with RLS policies
- ❌ **Single channel may not scale** beyond 50 patients per user
- ⚠️ **Performance degradation risk** as patient lists grow

## What We Need

1. **Server-side fan-out strategy** - Distribute updates across multiple channels
2. **Channel partitioning logic** - Split large patient lists into smaller channels
3. **Performance monitoring** - Track subscription performance metrics

## Implementation Plan

- **Phase 1:** Architecture design (1 hour)
  - Design multi-channel strategy for large patient lists
  - Define channel partitioning algorithm (e.g., 10 patients per channel)
  - Plan fallback mechanisms for channel failures

- **Phase 2:** Implementation (1-2 hours)
  - Update useRealtime hook with multi-channel support
  - Implement channel management logic
  - Add connection pooling and cleanup

- **Phase 3:** Testing and monitoring (30 minutes)
  - Load testing with 50+ patient scenarios
  - Performance monitoring integration
  - Error handling and recovery testing

## Business Impact

**Without this:**
- Poor user experience with 50+ patients
- Potential connection drops and missed updates
- Scalability ceiling limiting platform growth

**With this:**
- Smooth realtime experience regardless of patient list size
- Scalable architecture supporting enterprise healthcare users
- Maintained real-time functionality as platform grows

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Realtime performance maintained with 100+ patients per user
- [ ] Connection stability >99% uptime across all channels
- [ ] Graceful degradation during high-load scenarios
