# Healthcare Testing Edge Cases

**Impact:** LOW - Jest mock scope isolation affecting 2 test scenarios  
**Effort:** 1-2 hours (mock refactoring or test file restructuring)  
**Risk:** Test suite incompleteness, potential confusion during development  
**Trigger:** When achieving 100% test coverage becomes business-critical  

## Current State

- ✅ **Healthcare testing infrastructure production-ready** (React 19, Jest, RTL)
- ✅ **Core functionality fully validated** (7/9 useEventLogging tests passing)  
- ✅ **Critical healthcare patterns working** (PII sanitization, rate limiting, session management)
- ❌ **2 test edge cases failing** due to Jest mock scope isolation between describe blocks
- ⚠️ **Mock configuration complexity** may confuse future developers

## What We Need

1. **Jest mock scope isolation resolution** - Fix beforeEach override in healthcare describe block
2. **Mock initialization patterns** - Standardize healthcare test mocking across describe blocks  
3. **Test documentation** - Clear patterns for healthcare testing mock management

## Implementation Plan

- **Phase 1:** Mock scope debugging and resolution (1 hour)
  - Use `jest.resetModules()` or move healthcare tests to separate file
  - Validate mock function scope across describe blocks
  - Fix healthcare compliance test scenarios

- **Phase 2:** Test pattern documentation (30 minutes) 
  - Document healthcare testing mock patterns
  - Create clear examples for future healthcare test scenarios
  - Update testing guide with mock scope best practices

## Business Impact

**Without this:**
- 77% test success rate instead of 100%
- Potential developer confusion about mock patterns
- Incomplete test coverage reporting

**With this:**
- 100% test success rate and confidence
- Clear healthcare testing patterns for future development
- Complete test coverage validation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Healthcare compliance tests achieve 100% pass rate (2/2 failing tests fixed)
- [ ] Mock scope isolation patterns documented and standardized
- [ ] Healthcare testing guide updated with clear mock management examples

## Technical Details

### Failing Tests:
```
❌ should maintain session consistency for audit trails
❌ should categorize healthcare events with appropriate privacy levels
```

### Root Cause:
- Jest mock hoisting creates scope isolation
- Parent describe block's beforeEach runs after child beforeEach
- `mockUseProfile` needs explicit re-initialization in healthcare describe block

### Current Error Pattern:
```
Console: "Cannot log event: no current profile" 
Expected: 2/5 mock calls, Received: 0 mock calls
```

### Solution Options:
1. **jest.resetModules()** before healthcare tests
2. **Separate test file** for healthcare compliance scenarios  
3. **Explicit mock re-binding** in healthcare describe beforeEach

## Integration Points

- **Testing Strategy:** Links to healthcare testing infrastructure (Issue #23)
- **Phase 3 Development:** May be addressed during Week 2-3 quality improvements
- **Code Quality:** Part of overall test suite completeness goals
