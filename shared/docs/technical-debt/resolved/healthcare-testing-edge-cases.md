# Healthcare Testing Edge Cases

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED 2025-08-12**  
**Impact:** LOW - Jest mock scope isolation affecting 2 test scenarios  
**Effort:** 1-2 hours (mock refactoring or test file restructuring)  
**Risk:** Test suite incompleteness, potential confusion during development  
**Trigger:** When achieving 100% test coverage becomes business-critical  

## Resolution Summary

**Completed:** 2025-08-12 during Task 3.1 Performance Optimization  
**Approach:** React Context Provider wrapper strategy replaced brittle Jest module mocks  
**Result:** 100% test success rate (32/32 tests passing)

## Final State

- ✅ **Healthcare testing infrastructure production-ready** (React 19, Jest, RTL)
- ✅ **All tests passing** (9/9 useEventLogging tests, 17/17 ProfileSwitcher tests, 5/5 ProfileProvider tests)  
- ✅ **Healthcare patterns fully validated** (PII sanitization, rate limiting, session management, emergency scenarios)
- ✅ **Mock configuration simplified** using React Context Provider approach
- ✅ **Test patterns documented** for future healthcare development

## Implementation Completed

### **Phase 1: Mock Architecture Overhaul** ✅ COMPLETED
- **Solution:** Replaced Jest module mocks with React Context Provider wrapper
- **Approach:** Export ProfileContext from ProfileProvider for direct test control
- **Result:** Eliminated all Jest scope isolation issues

### **Phase 2: Test Pattern Standardization** ✅ COMPLETED  
- **Helper Functions:** Created reusable `createMockProfileContextValue()` and `renderHookWithContext()`
- **Code Reduction:** Eliminated 70+ lines of duplicate test setup across test files
- **Maintainability:** Established clean testing patterns for healthcare scenarios

### **Phase 3: Comprehensive Validation** ✅ COMPLETED
- **Test Coverage:** 100% pass rate achieved (32/32 tests)
- **Healthcare Scenarios:** Emergency profiles, permissions, archival status all covered
- **Performance:** Sub-1.5s test execution for comprehensive healthcare compliance suite

## Final Business Impact

**Achieved:**
- ✅ 100% test success rate and complete confidence in healthcare functionality
- ✅ Clean healthcare testing patterns documented and ready for future development  
- ✅ Production-ready testing infrastructure supporting all healthcare compliance requirements
- ✅ Simplified mock management eliminating developer confusion

## Final Success Criteria

- [x] ✅ Healthcare compliance tests achieve 100% pass rate (9/9 useEventLogging tests passing)
- [x] ✅ Mock patterns standardized using React Context Provider approach
- [x] ✅ Healthcare testing infrastructure documented and production-ready

## Technical Details

### Failing Tests:
```
❌ should maintain session consistency for audit trails
❌ should categorize healthcare events with appropriate privacy levels
```

### Root Cause:
- Jest mock hoisting creates scope isolation
- Parent describe block's beforeEach runs after child beforeEach
- `mockUseProfile` needs explicit re-initialization in healthcare describe block

### Current Error Pattern:
```
Console: "Cannot log event: no current profile" 
Expected: 2/5 mock calls, Received: 0 mock calls
```

### Solution Options:
1. **jest.resetModules()** before healthcare tests
2. **Separate test file** for healthcare compliance scenarios  
3. **Explicit mock re-binding** in healthcare describe beforeEach

## Integration Points

- **Testing Strategy:** Links to healthcare testing infrastructure (Issue #23)
- **Phase 3 Development:** May be addressed during Week 2-3 quality improvements
- **Code Quality:** Part of overall test suite completeness goals
