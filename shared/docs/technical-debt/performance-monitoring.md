# Performance Monitoring Infrastructure

**Impact:** HIGH - Can't detect performance regressions in production  
**Effort:** Medium (2-3 days)  
**Risk:** Database queries may degrade without detection, users experience slow app  
**Trigger:** When we reach 100+ active users

---

## **Current State**

### ✅ What's Working
- `pg_stat_statements` extension available for query tracking
- Proper database indexes in place (verified sub-millisecond on empty tables)
- RLS policies configured correctly
- Job queue infrastructure deployed

### ❌ What's Missing
- **No automated performance benchmarking** - Can't detect when queries slow down
- **No query performance alerts** - No notification when queries exceed thresholds  
- **No load testing infrastructure** - No way to test performance under realistic load
- **No synthetic data generators** - Can't test with realistic data volumes
- **No production query monitoring dashboard** - No visibility into real-world performance

### ⚠️ What's At Risk
- **Performance regressions go undetected** until users complain
- **Database queries optimized for empty tables** may fail with real data
- **RLS policy performance unknown** under load (could be 100x slower)
- **No baseline metrics** to compare against as system grows

---

## **What We Need**

### 1. **Synthetic Data Generation**
- Generate 1,000+ test patients with realistic medical data
- 50+ timeline events per patient (50,000+ total records)
- Realistic document volumes and clinical event distributions

### 2. **Automated Performance Benchmarking**
- Daily regression tests for critical queries:
  - Timeline query performance (`healthcare_timeline_events`)
  - RLS policy overhead on clinical tables
  - Job queue processing performance
  - Document search and filtering queries
- Automated alerts when performance degrades >20%

### 3. **Production Query Monitoring**
- Real-time slow query detection using `pg_stat_statements`
- Query performance dashboard with historical trends
- Automated alerts for queries exceeding thresholds:
  - >100ms for timeline queries
  - >50ms for RLS policy checks
  - >10s for background job processing

### 4. **Load Testing Framework**
- Simulate concurrent user scenarios:
  - Multiple users viewing timelines simultaneously
  - Document upload processing under load
  - Provider access to patient data (RLS testing)
- Automated load tests before each production deployment

---

## **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Basic Query Monitoring (4 hours)**
- Set up `pg_stat_statements` query tracking
- Create simple query performance logging
- Build basic slow query alerts (email/Slack)
- Document baseline performance metrics

### **Phase 2: Load Testing Framework (8 hours)**
- Build synthetic data generators (patients, timeline events, documents)
- Create load testing scripts for critical user flows
- Set up automated performance regression tests
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline

### **Phase 3: Production Dashboard & Automation (4 hours)**
- Build query performance monitoring dashboard
- Set up automated alerts for performance degradation
- Create performance trend analysis and reporting
- Document performance optimization procedures

---

## **Business Impact**

### **Without This:**
- **User Experience Degradation:** Performance issues discovered by users (bad reviews, churn)
- **Emergency Firefighting:** Reactive performance fixes under pressure
- **Scaling Uncertainty:** Don't know when system will break under load
- **Professional Credibility Risk:** Healthcare providers expect enterprise-grade performance

### **With This:**
- **Proactive Performance Management:** Issues caught and fixed before users notice
- **Confident Scaling:** Know exactly when and where to optimize
- **Professional Platform:** Healthcare-grade performance reliability
- **Data-Driven Optimization:** Performance improvements based on real metrics

---

## **Success Criteria**

- [ ] **Baseline Performance Documented:** All critical queries benchmarked with realistic data
- [ ] **Automated Regression Detection:** 100% of performance degradations >20% detected within 24 hours
- [ ] **Load Testing Coverage:** All critical user flows tested under 10x expected load
- [ ] **Production Monitoring:** Real-time query performance dashboard operational
- [ ] **Alert System:** Automated notifications for performance threshold breaches
- [ ] **Performance SLA:** Timeline queries <100ms, RLS checks <50ms, 99% uptime

## **Technical Implementation Notes**

### **Synthetic Data Requirements**
```sql
-- Target data volumes for realistic testing
- 1,000 test patients
- 50,000 timeline events (50 per patient average)
- 10,000 documents (10 per patient average)  
- 25,000 clinical events (25 per patient average)
- 5,000 provider interactions
```

### **Performance Thresholds**
```yaml
Critical Query Thresholds:
  timeline_query: 100ms
  rls_policy_check: 50ms
  document_search: 200ms
  job_processing: 10s
  
Alert Levels:
  warning: >50% of threshold
  critical: >100% of threshold
  emergency: >200% of threshold
```

### **Monitoring Stack Options**
- **Simple:** PostgreSQL `pg_stat_statements` + custom scripts
- **Advanced:** Grafana + Prometheus + PostgreSQL Exporter
- **Enterprise:** New Relic / DataDog (when revenue justifies cost)
