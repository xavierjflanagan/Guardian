# Provider Portal Realtime Scaling

**Impact:** DEFERRED - Future provider portal architecture requirement  
**Effort:** 1-2 weeks (research + architecture + implementation + testing)  
**Risk:** Provider portal performance issues with large patient loads  
**Trigger:** Provider portal Phase 4+ implementation  

## Current State

- ❌ **Provider portal not yet designed** - Architecture requirements unknown
- ❌ **Provider workflow patterns** not researched or documented
- ❌ **Scaling requirements** not validated with healthcare providers
- ⚠️ **Assumptions invalid** - Current patient portal patterns may not apply

## What We Need (Future Research)

1. **Provider workflow analysis** - How do doctors actually use patient data?
2. **Realtime requirements validation** - Do providers need live updates for 50+ patients?
3. **Architecture research** - Server-side vs client-side scaling approaches
4. **Performance requirements** - Response time SLAs for provider workflows

## Deferred Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Requirements Research (1 week)**
- **Healthcare provider interviews** - Understand actual workflow needs
- **Competitive analysis** - How do existing EMR systems handle realtime updates?
- **Performance requirements** - Define provider portal SLAs and metrics
- **Architecture options** - Research scaling patterns for multi-patient contexts

### **Phase 2: Architecture Design (2-3 days)**
- **Provider data access patterns** - Design optimized subscription strategies
- **Scaling approach selection** - Server-side fan-out vs client-side optimization
- **Integration planning** - How provider portal integrates with patient portal
- **Performance testing strategy** - Load testing with realistic provider scenarios

### **Phase 3: Implementation (3-5 days)**
- **Provider-optimized realtime hooks** - Separate from patient portal patterns
- **Multi-patient subscription management** - Handle 50-500+ patients per provider
- **Performance monitoring** - Provider-specific metrics and alerting
- **Load testing validation** - Verify performance with realistic provider loads

## Business Impact

### **Without This (Future Risk):**
- Provider portal performance issues with large patient loads
- Poor provider experience affecting platform adoption
- Architecture refactoring required after provider portal launch

### **With This (Future Benefit):**
- Scalable provider portal supporting large healthcare practices
- Professional EMR-grade performance for healthcare providers
- Architecture designed for healthcare enterprise requirements

## Success Criteria (Future)

- [ ] Provider portal handles 500+ patients per provider account
- [ ] Realtime updates <100ms for provider-critical workflows
- [ ] >99.5% uptime for provider portal realtime functionality
- [ ] Architecture scales to support healthcare enterprise clients

## Why This is Deferred

1. **Provider portal architecture** not yet designed - requirements unknown
2. **Patient portal focus** - Phase 3 priority is patient portal production readiness
3. **YAGNI principle** - Don't over-engineer for hypothetical future requirements
4. **Research needed** - Provider workflow requirements must be validated first

## Integration Plan

**Phase 4+:** After patient portal launch and provider portal requirements gathering:
1. Research actual provider workflow needs
2. Design provider-specific architecture 
3. Implement provider portal with validated scaling requirements
4. Performance test with realistic provider loads

**Note:** This replaces the incorrect "50+ patients per user" assumption in patient portal technical debt. Provider and patient portals have fundamentally different architecture requirements.
