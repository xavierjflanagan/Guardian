## 1. Project Goal

Build a prototype of "Guardian," an AI-powered healthcare app for uploading, analyzing, and managing medical records. The app should deliver a "wow-factor" UX and be maintainable, initially, by a solo developer. For a full overview, see the [Project Overview](../getting-started/overview.md).

## 2. Tech Stack & Architecture

The project uses a modern, scalable, and solo-dev friendly stack.

- **Core Stack:** Next.js, Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage), and Vercel for deployment.
- **Architecture:** The system is designed with a modular, pluggable document processing pipeline.

For complete details, please refer to the following documents:
- [Architecture Overview](../architecture/system-design.md)
- [Document Processing Pipeline](../architecture/data-pipeline.md)
- [ADR 0001: Database, Storage, and Authentication Stack Choice](../architecture/adr/0001-database-choice.md)
