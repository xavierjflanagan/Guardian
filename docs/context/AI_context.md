# AI Context

**Purpose:** Canonical project context for Guardian AI. Updated at the end of every session to reflect the latest state, decisions, and next steps.
**Last updated:** July 2025
**Audience:** Developers, AI contributors, project managers
**Prerequisites:** None

## 1. Project Goal

Build a prototype of "Guardian," an AI-powered healthcare app for uploading, analyzing, and managing medical records. The app should deliver a "wow-factor" UX and be maintainable, initially, by a solo developer. For a full overview, see the [Project Overview](../getting-started/overview.md).

## 2. Tech Stack & Architecture

The project uses a modern, scalable, and solo-dev friendly stack.

- **Core Stack:** Next.js, Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage), and Vercel for deployment.
- **Architecture:** The system is designed with a modular, pluggable document processing pipeline.

For complete details, please refer to the following documents:
- [Architecture Overview](../architecture/system-design.md)
- [Document Processing Pipeline](../architecture/data-pipeline.md)
- [ADR 0001: Database, Storage, and Authentication Stack Choice](../architecture/adr/0001-database-choice.md)

## 3. Session Updates

This section serves as a running log of progress, decisions, and next steps at the end of each development session.

### Session Update (2025-07-07)

**Progress:**
- Researched dual AI engine pipeline approach: expensive multimodal AI vs modulated cheaper models for A/B testing and cost optimization
- Extensive business development research: company registration, trading names, ABN, CBN, trademarking, internationalization considerations
- Documentation system optimization and enhanced sign-in/sign-off protocol implementation
- Identified redundancy in sole trader ABN setup due to company registration plans

**Decisions:**
- **Dual AI Pipeline Strategy**: Implement two parallel AI engines for comparative analysis and A/B testing culture
- **Company Name Pivot**: Guardian name has trademark conflicts, need to pivot to new company/trading name
- **Business Structure**: Moving from sole trader to company registration structure

**Context Evolution:**
- Project now includes business development considerations alongside technical implementation
- AI pipeline architecture expanded to include cost optimization and A/B testing framework
- Documentation protocols enhanced for better session management and context preservation

**Next Steps:**
- Local deployment testing (email and login functionality)
- AI pipeline implementation following dual-engine approach
- Company/trading name finalization and selection
- Focus on product implementation over documentation

**Blockers:**
- Guardian name trademark conflicts requiring urgent pivot to new name
- AI pipeline still in research phase, need to move to concrete implementation

### Session Update (2025-07-05)

**Progress:**
- Supabase Auth fully implemented: magic link sign-in replaces Clerk, with route protection via middleware.
- File upload helper and UI integrated: authenticated users can upload medical documents to Supabase Storage, with RLS and per-user bucket policies.
- Modular pipeline architecture documented in `docs/architecture/pipeline.md`, summarizing the pluggable, vendor-agnostic design and next steps.
- Linter and TypeScript errors resolved; project structure and config cleaned up for maintainability.

**Decisions:**
- All authentication and storage flows now use Supabase (see [ADR-0001](../decisions/0001-supabase-vs-neon.md)).
- Clerk and legacy auth code fully removed.
- `@` alias configured for imports; all source, config, and dependency files are tracked in git.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement the pluggable `document-processor` endpoint (Supabase Edge Function or Cloudflare Worker).
- Benchmark cold-start, latency, and cost for each compute option.
- Document RLS policies and Auth plan in a new `docs/security/rls-auth.md` file.

**Blockers/Open Questions:**
- None at this time. Ready to proceed with pipeline implementation and benchmarking.

### Previous Session (2025-07-03)

- **Repository:** Cleaned and force-pushed to GitHub.
- **File Structure:** Re-organized for clarity (`app/(auth)`, `app/(main)`, etc.).
- **Docs:** Key architectural decisions and setup guides were created. See [ADR-0001](../decisions/0001-supabase-vs-neon.md) and the [Supabase Setup Guide](../guides/supabase-setup.md).
