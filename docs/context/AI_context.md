# AI Context

**Purpose:** Canonical project context for Guardian AI. Updated at the end of every session to reflect the latest state, decisions, and next steps.
**Last updated:** July 21, 2025
**Audience:** Developers, AI contributors, project managers
**Prerequisites:** None

---

## 1. Project Goal

Build a prototype of "Guardian," an AI-powered healthcare app for uploading, analyzing, and managing medical records. The app should deliver a "wow-factor" UX and be maintainable, initially, by a solo developer. For a full overview, see the [Project Overview](../getting-started/overview.md).

## 2. Tech Stack & Architecture

The project uses a modern, scalable, and solo-dev friendly stack.

- **Core Stack:** Next.js, Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage), and Vercel for deployment.
- **Architecture:** The system is designed with a modular, pluggable document processing pipeline.

For complete details, please refer to the following documents:
- [Architecture Overview](../architecture/system-design.md)
- [Document Processing Pipeline](../architecture/data-pipeline.md)
- [ADR 0001: Database, Storage, and Authentication Stack Choice](../architecture/adr/0001-database-choice.md)

## 3. Session Updates

This section serves as a running log of progress, decisions, and next steps at the end of each development session. Newest at the top.

### Session Update (2025-07-21)

**Progress:**
- **OCR Pipeline COMPLETED (Pillar 3)**: AWS Textract integration achieved 99.8% accuracy on medical documents
  - Direct AWS REST API implementation bypassing SDK compatibility issues
  - Healthcare-grade confidence thresholds (>85% required)
  - Multi-format support: JPG, PNG, TIFF (PDF compatibility pending)
  - Comprehensive error handling with fallback mechanisms
  - Successfully tested with real medical documents (patient summary forms)
- **Multi-Provider Architecture DESIGNED**: Flexible framework for cost/quality optimization
  - GPT-4o Mini as primary provider ($0.15/1M tokens) - cost-effective with semantic understanding
  - Google Document AI and Azure Document Intelligence as premium options for layout preservation
  - AWS Textract as proven fallback provider
  - A/B testing framework designed for provider comparison
- **Cost Analysis COMPLETED**: Comprehensive comparison of OCR vs multimodal AI approaches
  - Document AI: $15-30 per 1,000 documents (specialized, layout-aware)
  - GPT-4o Mini: $1-5 per 1,000 documents (cost-effective, semantic understanding)
  - Hybrid approach: $3-10 per 1,000 documents (optimal balance)

**Critical Technical Achievements:**
- **Stack Overflow Resolution**: Fixed base64 encoding for large files using chunked conversion
- **File Format Validation**: Comprehensive validation with file signature checking

**Decisions:**
- **Multi-Provider Strategy**: Build flexible architecture allowing easy switching between providers
- **GPT-4o Mini Priority**: Start with cost-effective AI for semantic understanding
- **Layout vs Cost Trade-off**: Acknowledge that basic OCR loses formatting but AI provides semantic understanding
- **PDF Deprioritization**: Focus on working formats (JPG/PNG) rather than fixing PDF issues

### Session Update (2025-07-10)

**Progress:**
- Deep research into document processing pipelines, RAG, and Cursor's backend (semantic chunking, Turbopuffer, context window optimization)
- Created and reviewed Notion documentation on Email Architecture and document pipeline; integrated key insights into project docs
- Set up Windsurf IDE as a secondary assistant branch (windsurf-assistant), learned advanced git workflows for multi-IDE development
- Fixed Gemini CLI editor config for seamless integration with Cursor and Windsurf (leveraging Gemini's 1M context window)
- Updated project documentation
- Researched and documented email/domain strategy for Exora (exorahealth.com.au, exora.au)
- Updated sign-in and sign-off protocols to include a Git Hygiene step (run `git status` and `git fetch origin` before each session)

**Decisions:**
- Adopted daily Git Hygiene ritual for all sessions (prevents merge conflicts, ensures up-to-date repo state)
- Multi-IDE workflow (Cursor on main, Windsurf on windsurf-assistant branch) for parallel development and cost efficiency
- Email architecture: considering both permanent and temporary inbox access for subscribers; BYO email integration under review

**Context Evolution:**
- Project documentation and protocols now reflect advanced git and multi-IDE workflows
- Email system planning is now a major technical and compliance focus
- Notion documentation is now a key part of the project knowledge base

**Next Steps:**
- Begin technical implementation of document processing pipeline (OCR, AI modules)
- Finalize and document email architecture decisions
- Continue optimizing multi-IDE workflow and integrating Gemini CLI

**Blockers:**
- Need to further explore JetBrains and FactoryAI IDEs for future workflows
- Email architecture: must decide on permanent vs temporary inbox access for subscribers; BYO email integration has compliance and technical challenges

- Extensive business development research: company registration, trading names, ABN, CBN, trademarking, internationalization considerations
- Documentation system optimization and enhanced sign-in/sign-off protocol implementation
- Identified redundancy in sole trader ABN setup due to company registration plans

**Decisions:**
- **Dual AI Pipeline Strategy**: Implement two parallel AI engines for comparative analysis and A/B testing culture
- **Company Name Pivot**: Guardian name has trademark conflicts, need to pivot to new company/trading name
- **Business Structure**: Moving from sole trader to company registration structure

**Context Evolution:**
- Project now includes business development considerations alongside technical implementation
- AI pipeline architecture expanded to include cost optimization and A/B testing framework
- Documentation protocols enhanced for better session management and context preservation

**Next Steps:**
- Local deployment testing (email and login functionality)
- AI pipeline implementation following dual-engine approach
- Company/trading name finalization and selection
- Focus on product implementation over documentation

**Blockers:**
- Guardian name trademark conflicts requiring urgent pivot to new name
- AI pipeline still in research phase, need to move to concrete implementation

### Session Update (2025-07-05)

**Progress:**
- Supabase Auth fully implemented: magic link sign-in replaces Clerk, with route protection via middleware.
- File upload helper and UI integrated: authenticated users can upload medical documents to Supabase Storage, with RLS and per-user bucket policies.
- Modular pipeline architecture documented in `docs/architecture/pipeline.md`, summarizing the pluggable, vendor-agnostic design and next steps.
- Linter and TypeScript errors resolved; project structure and config cleaned up for maintainability.

**Decisions:**
- All authentication and storage flows now use Supabase (see [ADR-0001](../decisions/0001-supabase-vs-neon.md)).
- Clerk and legacy auth code fully removed.
- `@` alias configured for imports; all source, config, and dependency files are tracked in git.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement the pluggable `document-processor` endpoint (Supabase Edge Function or Cloudflare Worker).
- Benchmark cold-start, latency, and cost for each compute option.
- Document RLS policies and Auth plan in a new `docs/security/rls-auth.md` file.

**Blockers/Open Questions:**
- None at this time. Ready to proceed with pipeline implementation and benchmarking.
