   - Target audience
   - Prerequisites

2. **Cross-Reference Standards:** Use consistent linking format:
   ```markdown
   See [Architecture Overview](../architecture/README.md) for details.
   ```

3. **Code Examples:** All code blocks should include:
   - Language specification
   - Working examples
   - Expected output

#### C. Critical Missing Content

1. **API Documentation**
   - Document processing endpoint contracts
   - Authentication flow details
   - Error response formats

2. **Deployment Guide**
