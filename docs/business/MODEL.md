    - **AI Doctor Subscription:** Premium AI-driven health assistant at a higher tier (e.g., $11/month).
- **Data Aggregation Package:**
    - Human/AI agent aggregates all user health data from various sources on behalf of the user ($180 one-off fee).

    - Premium subscription plus per-session fee for telehealth consults (especially for overseas use, but available generally).

    - Premium feature that analyzes medication regimens, suggests savings, and tracks total dollars saved for users.
    - Feature can be promoted by showing average savings or personalized suggestions.

### Indirect Revenue

### Paywall & Donation System
- Paywall system in place from day one, at minimum to receive donations.
- Users can donate to support the platform, even if not subscribing.

## Community-Driven Revenue Models

- **Pay-It-Forward Program:** Users can fund subscriptions for others in need, fostering a sustainable giving cycle.
- **Sponsorship Platform:**
    - Users can sponsor premium subscriptions or contribute toward medication costs for those with financial constraints.
    - Transparent impact reporting for sponsors.
- **Impact Donation System:**
    - Structured donation program where contributions directly support app improvements and the mission of democratizing healthcare access.

*These models reinforce Guardian's mission of empowering users and building a community-focused ecosystem.*

## Crowdfunding

- **Internal Crowdfunding Rally:**
    - Users can contribute (e.g., $100) to buy a portion of a designated 10% shadow equity pie, represented as internal credits whose value tracks company valuation.
    - Example: 100,000 users contribute $100 each = $10M raised; company valuation $100M; each user gets $100 in app credits, which grow in value with the company.
    - Credits can be used for subscriptions and services, keeping value within the ecosystem.
    - Consider building this feature internally; see [granton.io](https://granton.io/leverage-crowdfunding-early-stage-funding/) and [birchal.com](https://www.birchal.com/) for inspiration.
