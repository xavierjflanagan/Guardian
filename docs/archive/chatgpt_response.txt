I take it you're aware based on my chat history and memory, of my previous project to build out an AI healthcare app thing via bolt for a bolt hackathon? Well the issue im facing is being overwhelmed and not sure what my next step should be. 
Updated context:
- I missed the Bolt hackathon deadline and so dont need to worry about continuing to use BOLT (although i do still have 3 weeks left of free bolt trial).
- my last update with the BOLT project i was working on ran into a brick wall because my connection API edge functions with supabase were not working due to supabase bug which they still havent responded to (because i have a free account with them so they dont care). This makes me wonder whether i should switch to an alternative datababse hosting platform like vercel or another? 
- I just downloaded the google gemini CLI, so can use that in terminal/cursor etc. Its very powerful so should consider using it moving forward but is not good at front end UX and doesnt do great job at creating beufiful user facing design like what loveable or bolt do. 
- I have chat gpt plus subscription that i pay $20 per month for. Does that get me Codex use? 
- I have cursor free 2 week subscription, but probs only 1 more week of that left. 

Summary 
- I am overhwhelmed by the offerings and dont know how to best proceed, or what tools or combination of tools to use are. 
- I wonder whether Bolt was holding us back in terms of overallk architectural design. I feel like i want to start from scratch  with the most powerful architecture bulding ai utilized for this. Also wonder whether we should move away from supabase given the edge function API failure. 

Question / task for you:
- please review my text above and summary and come up with a well thought out plan with the best recommendation based on my concerns and goals (my goal is a functioning prototype that users can use and be 'wowed' by). 
- do you need more context from me about my project if you cant access it atm? Also, my notion account has everything nicely spelled out - is there a way for you to access that as context?

Thought for 5 seconds
Below is a streamlined action plan that balances speed, reliability, and wow-factor UX while keeping monthly costs low.
I’ve broken it into four sections:

Where you are & key blockers

Stack & tooling recommendation (with fall-backs)

90-day roadmap in three sprints

Immediate next steps for the coming week

1. Where you are & key blockers
Area	Current status	Friction / risk
Hosting	Front-end on Bolt prototype; Edge Functions on Supabase (free tier)	Supabase bug blocking Edge Functions; limited support
Database	Supabase Postgres	OK for PoC, but downtime/support a risk
AI runtimes	ChatGPT Plus (o3 + GPT-4o), Gemini CLI (local), Cursor (trial week left)	Fragmented workflow; unclear orchestration
Design / UX	Bolt’s auto-generated UI	Limited polish; hard to customise
Your capacity	~2 hrs/day, solo	Need guardrails and automation

2. Recommended stack & tooling
Layer	Primary choice	Why	Fallback / alt.
Front-end	Next.js 14 + shadcn/ui deployed on Vercel	Free hobby tier; instant previews; first-class TS/React; easy auth middleware	Keep Bolt for quick throw-away prototypes
Auth	Clerk (free dev tier)	Drop-in email / OTP / social; works with Vercel middleware	Supabase Auth if you stay there
Database	Neon Postgres (serverless, generous free tier)	Supabase-compatible SQL & pooling; good support	Supabase (fix bug); PlanetScale (MySQL)
File storage	Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible)	Cheap egress; global edge	Supabase Storage
Serverless / APIs	Vercel Functions (for thin routing) ＋ Google Cloud Functions (heavy AI tasks)	Vercel = instant deployment next to front-end; GCP gives GPU/quota controls	Fly.io Machines for long-running OCR jobs
AI orchestration	LangGraph / LlamaIndex running inside GCP Functions; wrap Gemini & OpenAI calls	Handles agent routing you designed; plug-in other models easily	Simple queue & lambda chain
Local IDE	Cursor → VS Code (after trial) + GitHub Copilot Chat (free w/ Student)	Keeps “AI pair-programmer” inside editor	JetBrains Fleet + Gemini CLI
CI / CD	GitHub → Vercel auto-deploy; Neon DB branches for PRs	Zero config	GitLab / Railway

Why switch away from Supabase now?

The Edge Function bug + slow support on free tier is a real productivity sink.

Neon’s Postgres + Vercel integration gives the same SQL surface area without lock-in, and you can still move back.

You keep Supabase Storage/Auth accounts alive as a fallback.

3. 90-day roadmap (3×4-week sprints)
Sprint	Goal	Success metric	Key tasks
0. Setup Week (now-7 days)	All infra scaffolded; “Hello world” deploy	Health-check page live; DB schema migrated	- Move repo to GitHub ➜ Vercel import
- Create Neon DB & connect
- Set up Clerk & R2 buckets
- Create Vercel Function ping
1. Vertical slice (Weeks 1-4)	Users upload PDF ➜ see extracted text in profile table	< 1 min turnaround; < 2 € per 100 docs	- Implement R2 upload widget
- Vercel API route stores file-meta → Neon
- GCP Function with Tesseract OCR+Gemini Haiku summariser
- Display result in shadcn DataTable
2. Multi-agent pipeline (Weeks 5-8)	Cheap–>smart agent routing live; dedupe & tagging	30 % cost drop vs naïve GPT-4o pass	- Integrate LangGraph; add Lean Agent
- Write comparator agent
- Unit tests with 10 sample docs
3. Wow-factor UX + share links (Weeks 9-12)	Invite-only pilot; NPS ≥ 8 from 5 users	5 users complete upload flow	- Add “timeline” visual section
- Shareable read-only profile link
- Stripe test webhooks for future billing

4. Concrete next steps (this week)
Decide the stack (30 min)
– If the above feels right, spin up a clean repo: npx create-next-app@latest guardian-web --ts --app --tailwind.

Provision core services (2 hrs total)

bash
Copy
Edit
# Neon
neon create guardian-db
# Vercel
vercel link
# Clerk
clerk dev init
# R2
wrangler r2 bucket create guardian-files
Migrate schema

Move your existing Supabase health_records & documents tables via pg_dump | psql into Neon.

Verify with SELECT COUNT(*).

Kill the Supabase blocker (optional)

File a minimal repro with their GitHub issues to get async help; but press ahead with Neon so you’re unblocked.

Set up AI sandbox

In apps/functions/ocr.ts, stub a handler that calls Gemini 1.5 Flash first; fall back to GPT-3.5 if quota hit.

Deploy to GCP Cloud Functions (1st gen is fine) and store the HTTPS URL in an env var.

Commit & push – Vercel auto-build should give you a live URL. Share it with a friend—debug round-trip.

FAQ
Do you need more context from me?
A one-page architecture diagram and one sample medical PDF would cover 90 % of what I need for guidance. If you want hands-on code reviews, just paste the file or GitHub gist here.

Can ChatGPT access your Notion?
Not directly. You can export a Notion page as Markdown/PDF and drop the snippet or file, and I can walk through it.

Does ChatGPT Plus include Codex?
The underlying “o3” model you’re using is the evolution of Codex—so yes, you already have code-generation capability; no extra subscription needed.

Is Bolt still useful?
Keep it around as a one-click playground for UI prototypes, but treat Vercel/Next + shadcn as your production codebase.

Final thought
The combination of Vercel + Neon + Clerk gives you “big-company” DX with free-tier safety nets. Layer LangGraph over Gemini/OpenAI and you get your cost-optimised multi-agent pipeline while maintaining swap-in flexibility when better models appear.

Focus this week on momentum over perfection: once you see a PDF upload → table row appear end-to-end, the overwhelm fades and iteration gets fun again. Let me know when you hit that milestone and we’ll tackle the next slice.
