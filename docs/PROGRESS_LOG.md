## [2024-12-20] Documentation Review & Overhaul
- **What was accomplished:**
  - Comprehensive documentation review completed
  - New main README.md created with clear navigation
  - Documentation architecture recommendations defined
  - Implementation guide created with 3-week systematic plan
  - Identified critical gaps in API docs, deployment guides, and troubleshooting

- **Major decisions/changes:**
  - Established documentation standards and templates
  - Planned file structure reorganization
  - Prioritized content quality improvements
  - Set measurable documentation quality metrics

- **Blockers/open questions:**
  - Need to implement API documentation for document processing pipeline
  - Missing deployment procedures for production environment
  - Troubleshooting guide needs to be created

- **Next steps:**
  - Begin systematic implementation of documentation improvements
  - Update task management with current priorities
  - Fix broken links in existing documentation
  - Fill out remaining template files with actual content

## [2025-07-05] Authentication & File Upload Implementation
- **What was accomplished:**
  - Supabase Auth fully implemented with magic link sign-in
  - File upload helper and UI integrated with Supabase Storage
  - Modular pipeline architecture documented in `docs/architecture/pipeline.md`
  - Linter and TypeScript errors resolved
  - Project structure and config cleaned up for maintainability

- **Major decisions/changes:**
  - All authentication and storage flows now use Supabase (see ADR-0001)
  - Clerk and legacy auth code fully removed
  - `@` alias configured for imports
  - All source, config, and dependency files tracked in git

- **Blockers/open questions:**
  - Need to implement the pluggable `document-processor` endpoint
  - Need to benchmark cold-start, latency, and cost for compute options
  - Missing RLS policies and Auth documentation

- **Next steps:**
  - Implement pluggable document-processor endpoint (Supabase Edge Function or Cloudflare Worker)
  - Benchmark performance across different compute options
  - Document RLS policies and Auth plan in `docs/security/rls-auth.md`

## [2025-07-03] Repository Setup & Initial Architecture
- **What was accomplished:**
  - Repository cleaned and force-pushed to GitHub
  - File structure re-organized for clarity (`app/(auth)`, `app/(main)`, etc.)
  - Key architectural decisions documented
  - Supabase setup guide created

- **Major decisions/changes:**
  - ADR-0001 created for database, storage, and authentication stack choice
  - Chose Supabase over Neon + separate services for simplicity
  - Established modular, pluggable architecture principles

- **Blockers/open questions:**
  - None at this time

- **Next steps:**
  - Continue with authentication implementation
  - Set up file upload functionality
  - Begin AI pipeline development
