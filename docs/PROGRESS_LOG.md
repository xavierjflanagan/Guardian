# Progress Log

> This file is updated at the end of every coding session. It tracks daily/weekly progress, major changes, and next steps.

## [2025-08-06] Work Session Summary
- **Start Time:** 08:31 AEST
- **R&D Hours:** 9.0 hours
- **Claude's Structured Summary:**
  - **Key Accomplishments:**
    - Database Foundation Deployment COMPLETED: Successfully executed all SQL migration scripts through step 17, establishing the complete Guardian v7 database architecture (47 tables, 917 functions, 2 materialized views, 6 extensions)
    - Documentation Architecture REORGANIZED: Restructured the docs/architecture/ folder to align with individual pipeline sections, improving navigation and maintainability
    - Technical Debt Registry ESTABLISHED: Created dedicated docs/technical-debt/ folder with systematic documentation of debt that should not be worked on immediately, including trigger conditions and priority levels
    - Implementation Phase TRANSITION: Identified final 3 steps as frontend-dependent, successfully transitioning from backend database foundation to frontend development readiness
  - **Impact & Decisions:** This 9-hour session completed the entire database foundation implementation phase that was planned as the critical milestone for Guardian v7. The database architecture is now production-ready with comprehensive validation (sub-millisecond performance). The strategic decision to create a technical debt registry demonstrates professional development practices by documenting debt without immediate action. The documentation reorganization positions the project for efficient frontend development with clear architectural references.
- **Blockers:** None - database foundation complete and frontend-ready
- **Next Session Focus:** Frontend development planning and strategy for healthcare timeline, multi-profile dashboard, and document processing UI
- **User's Verbatim Log:**
  > I executed all the sql scripts up until step 17, with the last 3 steps dependent on front end. Rearranged the architecture documentation folder structure to account for the individual sections of the pipeline. Created a technical debt folder for documenting debt that shouldnt be worked on now. Tomorrow (7th Aug) will be focused on thinking about and planning the front end development, now that the database foundations structure is built out. The R&D hours i did for the day was 9 hours (8.30-6.30 with some breaks).

## [2025-07-28] Work Session Summary
- **Start Time:** 8:50 AEST
- **Accomplishments:** Most of the day still spent teasing out the architecture for the db schema and tyring to predict user experience to help with architecture design. Was using triad of o3, gemini and sonnet 4. Used opus 4 at the end. Spent time learning about claude code; commands, hooks. first tme really learning about hooks. 
Also spent time thinking about setting up some internal ops agents as part of the claude code subagent feature, but have been thinking about this for a while carrying on from my thoughts on sunday about setting up a roundtable of internal agents in a seperately built out standalone product to fasciliate operation across all parts of the company in anticiation of the 0-1, 1-10, 10-100 stages. I envisage this being an alternative approach to an IDE, where the round table has some agents that will need write access to the codebase repos, but others will not. They will each have their own sublte personalities and goals and priorities. Many will recieve vast data inputs from external sources. Some will have regular activation schedules, automated activation schedules, others will only activate on stimulus from the user or other agents. Each agent has the power to raise an issue or plan to the entire table, or to just individual agents directly, with the goal of attaining expert feedback from the other domains of the company. There is one cheief of staff master agent (Charlie) who is the main contact point with the user. Charlie summarizes all items for dsicussion from across the table to the user for final decision or for awareness. The user will talk to Charlie who decides which agent to delegate to, but the user can also discusss directly with the agents. An individual agent cannot make a change without the confirmation of the user, and that submission for change is required to be reviwed and seconded before reachign Charlie's desk. @RoundTable.md

## [2025-07-27] Work Session Summary
- **Start Time:** 10:30 AEST
- **Accomplishments:** Small day today (sunday) - Mainly filled with cerebral activities, brainstormed and designed out initial sketches for RoundTable; Family of internal operations AI agents that each have their own set role and priorities and importantly their own context and knowledge base about the company. A lot of them will also have their own information sources feeding into them. Some will have codebase write abilities, but each write will need to be A) reviewed by all primary agents + any additional that the proposing agent deems prudent B) post feedback session, proposal to be again reviewed by any agent that voiced concerns in initial feedback round C) Reviwed and approced by Charlie D) Presented to User for final Review and confirmation. User primarily communicates instructions and commands through Charlie who delegates to relevant agent/s, but User can also go direct to specific agents.

## [2025-07-23] Work Session Summary
- **Start Time:** From the Work Session Started block
- **Accomplishments:** build out the front end with bolt, gave bolt the codebase and prompt and it built, claude code then reviewed and made edits and moved it all to the root. did a lot of cerebral work today thinking and brainstorming - thought a lot about a doctor paltofrm to compliment the patient directed platform as i think that will ne beeded and also help growth. did a lot of code clean up. created a lot of issues for some big security issues (github issues) via claude code full deep dive into each issue and setting up the plan for each.
- **Blockers:** None reported
- **Next Session Focus:** continuing to build out the rest of the file processing pipeline - a) ensure data coming out of AI model is accurate, then start work on normalizing the json data into an organization relational db so that we can then start building out the front end better.
- **R&D Hours:** 8.0 hours
---

## [2025-07-22] Work Session Started
- **Start Time:** 09:37 AEST
- **Session Goals:** Review current AI processing pipeline status, verify AI JSON output captures all medical information, progress to next pipeline stage (normalize and clean JSON output for relational database storage), work on frontend via Windsurf with Bolt (using Claude Code prompts), investigate better AI dictation tools (beyond native Mac dictation), clean up ADR documentation in architecture folder
- **Planned Duration:** At least 9 hours
---

## [2025-07-21] Work Session Summary
- **Start Time:** 9:10 AEST
- **Accomplishments:** Its 10pm now and i started at 9am with total of 4 hours breaks (2 for lunch 2 for arvo walk dinner). so 9 hours as planned. 
i worked on the document processing pipeline today for most of the day - worked with claude code the whole time which was great. cleaned up some of the claude custom command documentation to streamline things in the future, proved that the github issues creation command works well. re AI pipeline. Conclusion was that OCR is pretty useless by itself but could be useful as an adjunct to the poweful AI model that ingest the raw image/file to help cross reference and also one day later we can orgainze to use the OCR as a filter check at the same time (i.e., if no words extracted its blank so dont feed to AI bot, or if word count is less than 10 than just feed ocr text output to AI instead,. perhaps, etc). So then we finally got the AI model embedded along with OCR and it was working well in the end providing confidence scores as well. the output was json and still need to verifiy that its outputting everything it should be from the original raw image, will no doubt be checking that tomorrow and the days to come. I also started working and thinking about the next stages in the pipeline - data normalization and storage in relational db, to then be brought forther to the user facing dashboard. logistically started thinking all about this - goign to use bolt for front end build, with claude code building out the initial in depth and well reviewed and researched prompt. then BOLT will be used for all thing user facing., also Windsurg IDE will try to only be used for this front end stuff for now to keep it seperate. WIth cursor claude code being the back end kind. Hit my claude code limit today at 10pm so just didnt get to buiulding the prompt but almost, windsurf claude code is going to build it and put it in the current github issue that exists for all this. then i will feed it to Bolt once im happy that weve thought through it well enough. Priorities for next session are go conitnue with the AI document processing pipeline, verifiy that the AI JSON output is indeed getting everything, try with some other files too. Then move on to the next cog in the pipeline - data json normalization for filing into the relational db. WIll also work on front end for fun and to change things up and start to understand how all that works which i think will help me while im thinkning about building out the normalization adn data structuring. 

*please c/p and record my written response above into the progress log verbatim, i think we should start inclduing my written almost diary like notes into the @PROGRESS_LOG.md , so please update the @signin.md and @signoff.md and @README.md files to reflect this update of my wishes
- **Blockers:** None reported
- **Next Session Focus:** Continue with the AI document processing pipeline, verify that the AI JSON output is indeed getting everything, try with some other files, then move on to data JSON normalization for filing into the relational DB, and start working on the front end for user-facing dashboard.
