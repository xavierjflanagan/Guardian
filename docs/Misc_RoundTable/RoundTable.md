Initial thoughts 28/07/2025:
Have been thinking about this for a while carrying on from my thoughts on sunday about setting up a roundtable of internal agents in a seperately built out standalone product to fasciliate operation across all parts of the company in anticiation of the 0-1, 1-10, 10-100 stages. I envisage this being an alternative approach to an IDE, where the round table has some agents that will need write access to the codebase repos, but others will not. They will each have their own sublte personalities and goals and priorities. Many will recieve vast data inputs from external sources. Some will have regular activation schedules, automated activation schedules, others will only activate on stimulus from the user or other agents. Each agent has the power to raise an issue or plan to the entire table, or to just individual agents directly, with the goal of attaining expert feedback from the other domains of the company. There is one cheief of staff master agent (Charlie) who is the main contact point with the user. Charlie summarizes all items for dsicussion from across the table to the user for final decision or for awareness. The user will talk to Charlie who decides which agent to delegate to, but the user can also discusss directly with the agents. An individual agent cannot make a change without the confirmation of the user, and that submission for change is required to be reviwed and seconded before reachign Charlie's desk. 

RoundTable; Family of internal operations AI agents that each have their own set role and priorities and importantly their own context and knowledge base about the company. A lot of them will also have their own information sources feeding into them. Some will have codebase write abilities, but each write will need to be A) reviewed by all primary agents + any additional that the proposing agent deems prudent B) post feedback session, proposal to be again reviewed by any agent that voiced concerns in initial feedback round C) Reviwed and approced by Charlie D) Presented to User for final Review and confirmation. User primarily communicates instructions and commands through Charlie who delegates to relevant agent/s, but User can also go direct to specific agents.

Claude Code Integration and Automation Guide
External System Integration
Unix-style Integration
Claude Code follows Unix philosophy and is composable and scriptable(1). You can pipe data through Claude and get structured output:
cat build-error.txt | claude -p 'concisely explain the root cause of this build error' > output.txt
(2)
Output Format Control
Control output format for integration with other tools(2):
# Text format (default)
cat data.txt | claude -p 'summarize this data' --output-format text > summary.txt

# JSON format
cat code.py | claude -p 'analyze this code for bugs' --output-format json > analysis.json

# Streaming JSON format
cat log.txt | claude -p 'parse this log file for errors' --output-format stream-json
(2)
MCP Integration
Claude Code supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) which can pull from external datasources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack(1). MCP lets Claude read your design docs, update tickets, or use custom developer tooling(1).
CI/CD Automation
Claude Code can be integrated into CI pipelines for automated workflows(1). Examples include automatically translating new text strings and raising PRs for review teams(1).
Running Multiple Independent Claude Code Sessions
Git Worktrees for Parallel Sessions
Git worktrees allow you to check out multiple branches from the same repository into separate directories(2). Each worktree has its own working directory with isolated files, while sharing the same Git history(2).
# Create a new worktree with a new branch 
git worktree add ../project-feature-a -b feature-a

# Navigate to each worktree and run Claude Code independently
cd ../project-feature-a

Complete Independence
* Each worktree has its own independent file state, making it perfect for parallel Claude Code sessions(2)
* Changes made in one worktree won't affect others, preventing Claude instances from interfering with each other(2)
* All worktrees share the same Git history and remote connections(2)
Independent CLAUDE.md Files Per Worktree
Memory File Isolation
Since each Git worktree has its own separate working directory with isolated files(2), any CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md files you create in each worktree will be completely independent.
Memory File Options
* CLAUDE.md - Can be checked into git and shared with your team(3)
* CLAUDE.local.md - Personal project-specific preferences that you can .gitignore(3)
Non-Interactive Automation
Command Line Prompts
Send prompts directly via command line without entering interactive chat(2):
claude -p 'concisely explain the root cause of this build error'
(2)
Piping Input
Claude Code works as a Unix-style utility and accepts piped input(2):
cat build-error.txt | claude -p 'concisely explain the root cause of this build error' > output.txt

tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream"
(1)(2)
Build Script Integration
Add Claude to your build scripts for automated verification(2):
// package.json
{
    "scripts": {
        "lint:claude": "claude -p 'you are a linter. please look at the changes vs. main and report any issues related to typos. report the filename and line number on one line, and a description of the issue on the second line. do not return any other text.'"
    }
}
(2)
Custom Slash Commands
Create custom slash commands that accept arguments for repeated workflows(3):
echo "Please analyze and fix the GitHub issue: $ARGUMENTS..." > .claude/commands/fix-github-issue.md
(3)
Then use programmatically: /fix-github-issue 1234(3)
