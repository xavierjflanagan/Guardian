## 1. Building a Unified Monitoring Console

| Capability | Supabase | Render | Sentry |
|------------|----------|--------|--------|
| **Logs** | Logflare REST/WebSocket API exposes function, auth, storage logs | REST API provides application logs | Fully featured (issues, breadcrumbs, transactions) |
| **DB Metrics** | Query Postgres views (`pg_stat_*`) over SQL / RPC | n/a | n/a |
| **Platform Usage** | UI only (bandwidth, storage, invocation counts) – *no public API yet* | UI only for CPU/RAM/latency – *API on roadmap* | API & GraphQL for all metrics |
| **Service Metadata** | Project settings available via `supabase-api` endpoints (limited) | List services & deploy status via REST | n/a |
| **Custom Metrics** | Emit from functions/workers (StatsD, OTLP, etc.) | Run exporters inside container | Send custom events/transactions |

### Practical Integration Strategy
1. **Supabase**  
   • Pull JSON logs from Logflare.  
   • Run SQL queries for `pg_stat_database`, `pg_stat_statements`, etc.  
   • Scrape Usage page *or* wait for future API.

2. **Render**  
   • Fetch service list & deployment status via REST.  
   • Download build/runtime logs.  
   • Export CPU/RAM metrics from inside each container (Prometheus, StatsD, Datadog agent) until Render ships metrics API.

3. **Sentry**  
   • Use REST or GraphQL to stream issue counts, performance samples, alerts.

4. **Storage & UI**  
   • Store everything in a time-series DB (TimescaleDB / Influx / Prometheus / ClickHouse).  
   • Build a React/Next.js dashboard or plug Grafana on top.  
   • Tag with `provider`, `service`, `environment`, etc. for unified querying.  
   • Alert via Slack / PagerDuty when thresholds are crossed.

## 4. Benefits of the Approach

* Removes 30 s edge-runtime bottleneck for heavy jobs.
* Improves user experience (fast upload acknowledgment). 
* Enables horizontal scaling of workers.
* Single pane-of-glass monitoring across infrastructure & application layers.
* Clear path to add cost, growth, and product metrics alongside infra data.

## 5. Open Items / Next Steps

1. Choose a queue implementation (Postgres table + `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, Supabase Realtime channel, or external queue).
2. Decide on the time-series store for monitoring data.
3. Implement minimal ingestion adapters:
   - Supabase Logflare stream
   - Render log REST puller
   - Sentry REST client
4. Prototype Grafana dashboard or custom React UI.
5. Review Render roadmap for metrics API; update integration when available.
