SELECT * FROM check_system_health();
```

### Supabase Configuration Optimization

#### Recommended Settings
```toml
# Database Configuration (apply via Supabase Dashboard)
max_connections = 200
shared_buffers = "256MB"  # 25% of available RAM

work_mem = "8MB"  # For concurrent healthcare queries
maintenance_work_mem = "256MB"
checkpoint_timeout = "10min"
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
wal_buffers = "16MB"
default_statistics_target = 200  # Enhanced for medical data analysis
```

#### Connection Pooling Strategy
