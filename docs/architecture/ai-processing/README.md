## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Current Stack**
- **OCR:** AWS Textract via Supabase Edge Functions
- **AI Processing:** Multi-provider framework (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- **Queue System:** Supabase job queue with PostgreSQL
- **Monitoring:** Comprehensive logging and error tracking
- **Storage:** Processed data in PostgreSQL with audit trails

### **AI Extraction Prompt Engineering**
```
Extract medical information from this document text:

REQUIRED EXTRACTIONS:
- Medications (name, dosage, frequency, dates, prescribing doctor)
- Allergies (substance, reaction type, severity, onset date)
- Medical conditions (diagnosis, dates, ICD codes if present, status)
- Procedures (name, date, outcome, performing provider)
- Test results (test name, values, dates, reference ranges, abnormal flags)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each extracted item, provide:
1. Exact text from source document (verbatim quote)
2. Justification for medical relevance (why this is clinically significant)
3. Confidence score (0-100, based on text clarity and medical context)
4. Suggested metadata tags (medication, allergy, condition, procedure, test_result)
5. Temporal classification (current, historical, planned, discontinued)

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Confidence >95% for auto-approval
- Confidence <95% flagged for human review
- 100% source traceability to original document
- No hallucination - only extract information explicitly present
```
