# Guardian Unified Data Architecture v7

**Status:** In Development  
**Date:** 2025-07-29  
**Version:** 7.0  

---

## Overview

Guardian v7 represents a major architectural evolution, transitioning from a monolithic documentation approach to a modular, maintainable architecture that incorporates modern healthcare interoperability standards and user-centric design principles.

**Key Improvements in v7:**
- üèóÔ∏è **Modular Architecture**: Split into focused, maintainable modules
- üïí **Healthcare Journey**: Comprehensive patient timeline and healthcare story logging
- üè• **Healthcare Standards**: FHIR/HL7 integration for interoperability
- üë§ **User-Centric**: Enhanced consent management and personalization
- üöÄ **Performance**: Advanced queuing and real-time capabilities
- üîí **Security**: Granular consent and audit improvements

## Architecture Principles

### 1. **Modular Design**
Each module is self-contained with clear interfaces and dependencies, enabling parallel development and maintenance.

### 2. **Healthcare-First**
Built with FHIR standards and healthcare compliance requirements as first-class citizens, not afterthoughts.

### 3. **User Ownership**  
Patients have granular control over their data with comprehensive consent management and audit trails. Architecture designed for future provider portal integration while maintaining patient data sovereignty.

### 4. **Performance by Design**
Optimized for healthcare data patterns with appropriate indexing, partitioning, and caching strategies.

### 5. **Security & Privacy**
Multi-layered security with RLS, field-level encryption options, and comprehensive audit logging.

## Getting Started
1. **Review Core Schema** - Start with the foundational database design
2. **Understand Security Model** - Review RLS policies and compliance features  
3. **Plan Implementation** - Follow the implementation guide for fresh deployment
4. **Deploy Features** - Use the roadmap for phased rollout

---

## Design Evolution
- **v7.0** (2025-07-29): Production-ready modular architecture with FHIR integration
- **v7.1 (Planned)**: Provider portal integration with universal provider registry and access control
- **v6.0-v1.0** (2025-07-26 to 2025-07-28): Design and planning phases (archived)

## Contributing

When contributing to v7 modules:

1. **Single Responsibility** - Each module should have a clear, focused purpose
2. **Clear Dependencies** - Document any cross-module dependencies
3. **Migration Path** - Include migration instructions for schema changes
4. **Testing** - Add appropriate test scenarios for new features
5. **Documentation** - Update both technical and user-facing documentation
