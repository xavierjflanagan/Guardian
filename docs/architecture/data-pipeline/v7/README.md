# Guardian Unified Data Architecture v7

**Status:** In Development  
**Date:** 2025-07-28  
**Version:** 7.0  

---

## Overview

Guardian v7 represents a major architectural evolution, transitioning from a monolithic documentation approach to a modular, maintainable architecture that incorporates modern healthcare interoperability standards and user-centric design principles.

**Key Improvements in v7:**
- üèóÔ∏è **Modular Architecture**: Split into focused, maintainable modules
- üè• **Healthcare Standards**: FHIR/HL7 integration for interoperability
- üë§ **User-Centric**: Enhanced consent management and personalization
- üöÄ **Performance**: Advanced queuing and real-time capabilities
- üîí **Security**: Granular consent and audit improvements

## Architecture Modules

### Core Foundation
- **[Core Schema](./core-schema.md)** - Database foundation, relationships, and core tables
- **[Security & Compliance](./security-compliance.md)** - RLS policies, audit trails, GDPR compliance
- **[Performance & Monitoring](./performance-monitoring.md)** - Indexing, partitioning, metrics

### Modern Healthcare Features
- **[Healthcare Interoperability](./healthcare-interoperability.md)** - FHIR/HL7 integration and mappings
- **[User Experience](./user-experience.md)** - Consent management, preferences, notifications

### Implementation & Operations
- **[Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md)** - Phased rollout plan and timelines
- **[Testing](./testing/)** - Test scenarios, benchmarks, and security cases

---

## Migration from v6

Guardian v7 is designed for incremental migration from v6 with backward compatibility:

- **[Migration Guide](../migration-guides/v6-to-v7-migration.md)** - Step-by-step upgrade instructions
- **[SQL Migrations](../migration-guides/sql-migrations/)** - Database schema changes
- **[Rollback Scripts](../migration-guides/rollback-scripts/)** - Safety rollback procedures

## Architecture Principles

### 1. **Modular Design**
Each module is self-contained with clear interfaces and dependencies, enabling parallel development and maintenance.

### 2. **Healthcare-First**
Built with FHIR standards and healthcare compliance requirements as first-class citizens, not afterthoughts.

### 3. **User Ownership**
Patients have granular control over their data with comprehensive consent management and audit trails.

### 4. **Performance by Design**
Optimized for healthcare data patterns with appropriate indexing, partitioning, and caching strategies.

### 5. **Security & Privacy**
Multi-layered security with RLS, field-level encryption options, and comprehensive audit logging.

## Contributing

When contributing to v7 modules:

1. **Single Responsibility** - Each module should have a clear, focused purpose
2. **Clear Dependencies** - Document any cross-module dependencies
3. **Migration Path** - Include migration instructions for schema changes
4. **Testing** - Add appropriate test scenarios for new features
5. **Documentation** - Update both technical and user-facing documentation
