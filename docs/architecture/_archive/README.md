# Architecture Archive

**Historical architecture versions and evolutionary documentation.**

---

## üìö **Purpose**

This archive contains previous versions of Guardian's architecture for:
- **Historical reference** during troubleshooting
- **Evolution understanding** for new team members  
- **Decision context** when revisiting architectural choices

## üóÇÔ∏è **Archive Structure**

### **v1-v6 Evolution** (`v1-v6/`)
All previous unified data architecture versions and planning documents from the intensive design phase (July 26-28, 2025).

**Key Evolution Highlights:**
- **v1-v2**: Initial concept and basic normalization
- **v3-v4**: Healthcare standards integration attempts
- **v5**: Multi-AI collaborative design (O3, Gemini, Claude)
- **v6**: Final pre-v7 architecture with comprehensive review

### **v7 Review Process** (`v7-reviews/`)
Complete record of the multi-AI collaborative review and refinement process that transformed v7 into production-ready architecture (August 4-5, 2025).

**Process Phases:**
- **Initial Reviews**: Independent analysis by O3, Gemini, and Sonnet4
- **Meta-Reviews**: Implementation execution and gap identification
- **Collaborative Synthesis**: Gemini-Claude collaborative refinement and final strategy

**Innovation:** Documents the first successful multi-AI collaborative architectural methodology

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Archive Usage Guidelines**

1. **Reference Only**: These documents are not maintained or updated
2. **No Implementation**: Do not implement archived architecture versions
3. **Context Understanding**: Use to understand decision evolution
4. **Current Architecture**: Always use `/docs/architecture/current/` for implementation
