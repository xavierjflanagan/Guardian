## 3. Provider Portal Detailed Implementation Plan (Phase 5)

**Timeline:** Post-patient platform launch (Estimated 6-8 months)  
**Status:** Future Planning Phase  
**Dependencies:** Guardian v7 patient platform fully operational ✅

### 3.1. Provider Portal Implementation Overview

The provider portal represents Guardian's evolution into a true healthcare ecosystem platform. This phase builds upon the robust v7 foundation to create secure, compliant provider access while maintaining patient data sovereignty.

#### Core Architecture Strategy:
- **Extend, Don't Replace**: All provider functionality builds on existing v7 clinical events and audit systems
- **Patient-Controlled Access**: Providers access patient data only with explicit, granular consent
- **Unified Database**: Single source of truth with enhanced RLS policies for provider access
- **Monorepo Structure**: Provider portal as workspace within existing Guardian repository

### 3.2. Provider Portal Implementation Phases

#### Phase 5.1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
**Universal Provider Registry & Access Control**

```sql
-- NOTE: These tables already exist from your v7 deployment!
-- provider_registry table - ✅ Already deployed
-- patient_provider_access table - ✅ Already deployed
-- Enhanced security functions - ✅ Already deployed
```

#### Phase 5.2: AHPRA Integration & Authentication (Weeks 5-8)
**Complete Original O3 Ticket Within Provider Portal Context**

- Enhanced AHPRA ETL with provider registry integration
- Provider authentication flow with 2FA requirement
- Registry verification pipeline
- Provider onboarding workflow

#### Phase 5.3: Provider Portal MVP (Weeks 9-12)
**Core Provider Interface**

- Provider dashboard with active patient list
- Patient data access with audit logging
- Basic clinical decision support alerts
- Provider profile management

#### Phase 5.4: Advanced Clinical Features (Weeks 13-16)
**Clinical Decision Support & Collaboration**

- Medication optimization suggestions
- Screening due alerts with billing codes
- Inter-provider referral system
- Provider-to-provider data sharing

### 3.3. Key Integration Points with v7

1. **Clinical Events**: Provider actions create entries in existing `patient_clinical_events` ✅
2. **Audit System**: Provider access logged in existing partitioned `audit_log` ✅
3. **Security Framework**: Provider RLS policies extend existing user isolation ✅
4. **Feature Flags**: Provider features use existing `feature_flags` infrastructure ✅
5. **FHIR Integration**: Provider data uses existing FHIR transformation functions ✅

### 3.4. Success Criteria for Provider Portal

#### Technical Milestones:
- [ ] Universal provider registry operational with AHPRA integration
- [ ] Patient-provider access control system with granular permissions
- [ ] Provider authentication with registry verification
- [ ] Clinical decision support generating actionable alerts
- [ ] Complete audit trail of all provider-patient interactions

#### Business Impact:
- [ ] 10+ healthcare providers verified and active
- [ ] 100+ patients have granted provider access
- [ ] Clinical decision support reducing medication optimization opportunities by 30%
- [ ] Provider satisfaction score >4.5/5
- [ ] Zero security incidents or data breaches
