🚨 **IMPORTANT:** The SQL scripts have been comprehensively reviewed and fixed:

- ✅ **All dependency issues resolved** - Scripts now execute in correct order (000-013)
- ✅ **Missing tables added** - Core clinical tables now included in proper sequence
- ✅ **Security hardened** - Enhanced provider verification and canonical security functions
- ✅ **Audit trails fixed** - Proper patient_id linking for all tables including documents
- ✅ **Schema consistency** - All referenced columns now exist (e.g., `is_public` in provider_registry)
- ✅ **Race conditions eliminated** - Atomic operations for consent management

**Status: PRODUCTION READY** 🎯

## 1. Pre-Implementation Setup

### 1.1. Environment Preparation

```sql
-- Check PostgreSQL readiness for Guardian v7

                    THEN 'Tables Exist' ELSE 'Clean' END,
               CASE WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'documents') 
                    THEN 'Review Existing Schema' ELSE 'Ready for Fresh Implementation' END,
               CASE WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'documents') 
                    THEN 'Review and clean if needed' ELSE 'Proceed with implementation' END
    )
    SELECT * FROM assessment;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Run assessment
SELECT * FROM assess_implementation_readiness();
```

### 1.2. Backup Strategy Setup

```bash
# Setup backup directory and procedures for implementation
mkdir -p guardian_backups
cd guardian_backups

# Create initial backup before implementation
pg_dump guardian_db > guardian_pre_implementation_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Setup automated backup script for implementation phase
cat > backup_during_implementation.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
pg_dump guardian_db > "guardian_implementation_backup_${TIMESTAMP}.sql"
echo "Backup created: guardian_implementation_backup_${TIMESTAMP}.sql"
EOF

chmod +x backup_during_implementation.sh
```

## 6. Support & Troubleshooting

### System Health Monitoring

```sql
-- Run regular system health checks
SELECT * FROM check_system_health();

-- Check for failed audit events
SELECT COUNT(*) as failed_audits, 
       MIN(failure_timestamp) as oldest_failure
FROM failed_audit_events 
WHERE resolved_at IS NULL;

-- Monitor job queue health
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count, 
       AVG(EXTRACT(minutes FROM NOW() - created_at)) as avg_age_minutes
FROM job_queue 
GROUP BY status;
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Provider Verification Issues**
   ```sql
   -- Check provider registry verification status
   SELECT id, guardian_provider_id, account_verified, has_guardian_account
   FROM provider_registry 
   WHERE account_verified = FALSE;
   ```

2. **Audit System Monitoring**
   ```sql
   -- Check for audit failures
   SELECT attempted_table_name, failure_reason, COUNT(*)
   FROM failed_audit_events 
   WHERE resolved_at IS NULL
   GROUP BY attempted_table_name, failure_reason;
   ```

3. **Timeline Generation Issues**
   ```sql
   -- Verify timeline triggers are active
   SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation, action_statement 
   FROM information_schema.triggers 
   WHERE trigger_name LIKE '%timeline%';
   ```
