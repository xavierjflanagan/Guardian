# Guardian Architecture Documentation

**Purpose:** Complete architectural documentation for the Guardian healthcare platform  
**Last updated:** August 2025  
**Status:** Production-ready database foundation, AI processing pipeline in development  

---

## 🏗️ **Complete Guardian Pipeline**

Guardian processes healthcare data through a comprehensive pipeline designed for accuracy, security, and user experience:

```
📤 Data Ingestion → 🤖 AI Processing → 🗄️ Database Foundation → 📱 Frontend Experience
```

### **Pipeline Overview**

1. **📤 Data Ingestion** - Multiple pathways for healthcare data entry
2. **🤖 AI Processing** - OCR/AI extraction and medical data analysis  
3. **🗄️ Database Foundation** - Secure storage, normalization, and compliance
4. **📱 Frontend Experience** - User interfaces and healthcare journey visualization

## 📋 **Architecture Principles**

### **1. Healthcare-First Design**
- FHIR/HL7 standards integration
- HIPAA/GDPR compliance by design
- Clinical data accuracy and traceability

### **2. Multi-Stage Pipeline**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Each stage independently scalable
- Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks

### **3. Family-Centric Architecture**
- Multi-profile support (patients, dependents, pets)
- Granular consent management
- Cross-profile healthcare coordination

### **4. Security & Privacy**
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Field-level encryption capabilities

### **5. Performance by Design**
- Sub-millisecond query performance
- Optimized indexing and partitioning
- Scalable to millions of records

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **For Developers**
1. **Database Foundation** - Start with [implementation guide](./database-foundation/implementation/guide.md)
2. **AI Processing** - Review [OCR integration](./ai-processing/ocr-integration/) and [AI extraction](./ai-processing/ai-extraction/)
3. **Frontend Development** - Check [design system](./frontend/design.md) and [component specifications](./frontend/prompts/)

### **For System Architects**
1. **Complete Pipeline** - Review each stage's architecture documentation
2. **Integration Points** - Study [healthcare interoperability](./database-foundation/integration/healthcare-interoperability.md)
3. **Scaling Strategy** - Review [performance](./database-foundation/core/performance.md) and [scalability planning](../technical-debt/scalability-planning.md)

### **For Healthcare Professionals**
1. **Data Security** - Review [security & compliance](./database-foundation/core/security-compliance.md)
2. **Clinical Workflow** - Study [healthcare journey](./database-foundation/features/healthcare-journey.md)
3. **Provider Integration** - Check [provider portal](./database-foundation/features/provider-portal.md) plans
