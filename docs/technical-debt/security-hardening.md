# Security Hardening Audit

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Potential compliance gaps and security vulnerabilities  
**Effort:** Medium (1-2 days)  
**Risk:** Security incidents, compliance failures, data breaches  
**Trigger:** Before public launch or first 1,000 users

---

## **Current State**

### ✅ What's Working
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies implemented
- Enhanced audit logging with fallback system
- Provider verification system with two-tier authentication
- Encrypted database connections (Supabase)
- Authentication via Supabase Auth (magic links)

### ❌ What's Missing
- **No penetration testing** performed
- **No security code review** by external auditor
- **No secret management audit** (API keys, database credentials)
- **No compliance documentation** (HIPAA, GDPR readiness)
- **No incident response procedures**

### ⚠️ What's At Risk
- **Unknown security vulnerabilities** in application code
- **Potential RLS policy bypasses** not discovered
- **Insecure secret handling** practices
- **Compliance violations** discovered during audit

## **What We Need**

### 1. **Security Code Review**
- External security audit of application code
- RLS policy penetration testing
- API endpoint security assessment
- Authentication flow security review

### 2. **Compliance Documentation**
- HIPAA compliance checklist and documentation
- GDPR compliance assessment and procedures
- Data retention and deletion policies
- Privacy policy and terms of service review

### 3. **Secret Management Audit**
- Review all API keys and database credentials
- Implement proper secret rotation procedures
- Audit environment variable security
- Document secret management best practices

### 4. **Incident Response Planning**
- Create security incident response procedures
- Document data breach notification requirements
- Establish security monitoring and alerting
- Train team on security incident handling

---

## **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Internal Security Review (1 day)**
- Comprehensive code review for security vulnerabilities
- RLS policy testing and validation
- Secret management audit and cleanup
- Document current security measures

### **Phase 2: External Security Audit (1 day)**
- Hire external security consultant for penetration testing
- Third-party review of authentication and authorization
- Compliance assessment (HIPAA/GDPR)
- Security recommendations implementation
