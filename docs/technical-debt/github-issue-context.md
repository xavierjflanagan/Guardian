# GitHub Issue: Performance Monitoring Infrastructure

**Title:** Performance Monitoring Infrastructure - Technical Debt

**Labels:** technical-debt, enhancement, performance, monitoring

**Priority:** High

**Description:**

## Problem Statement

Guardian v7 database foundation is production-ready, but we lack performance monitoring infrastructure to detect regressions as the system scales. Current performance tests show sub-millisecond execution on empty tables, but real-world performance under load is unknown.

## Impact

**Without monitoring:**
- Performance regressions discovered by users (bad UX)
- No baseline metrics for optimization decisions  
- Scaling bottlenecks discovered too late
- Emergency firefighting instead of proactive management

**With monitoring:**
- Proactive performance optimization
- Data-driven scaling decisions
- Professional healthcare-grade reliability
- User experience remains consistently fast

## Technical Details

**Current State:**
- ✅ `pg_stat_statements` extension available
- ✅ Proper database indexes implemented
- ✅ RLS policies configured correctly
- ❌ No automated performance benchmarking
- ❌ No query performance alerts
- ❌ No load testing infrastructure

**Requirements:**
1. Synthetic data generation (1,000+ test patients, 50,000+ timeline events)
2. Automated performance regression tests for critical queries
3. Real-time slow query detection and alerting
4. Load testing framework for concurrent user scenarios

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Basic Monitoring (4 hours)**
- Set up `pg_stat_statements` query tracking
- Create slow query alerts (>100ms timeline, >50ms RLS)
- Document baseline performance metrics

**Phase 2: Load Testing (8 hours)**  
- Build synthetic data generators
- Create load testing scripts for critical flows
- Automated performance regression tests

**Phase 3: Production Dashboard (4 hours)**
- Query performance monitoring dashboard
- Automated alerts for degradation >20%
- Performance trend analysis and reporting

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All critical queries benchmarked with realistic data volumes
- [ ] 100% of performance degradations >20% detected within 24 hours
- [ ] Load testing coverage for all critical user flows
- [ ] Timeline queries <100ms, RLS checks <50ms consistently

## Trigger Condition

This becomes critical when we reach **100+ active users** or before public launch.

## Business Context

Healthcare applications require enterprise-grade performance reliability. Users (patients and providers) expect instant access to critical medical information. Performance monitoring ensures we maintain professional standards as we scale.
