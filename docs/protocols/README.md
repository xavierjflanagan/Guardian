# AI Protocol System - Guardian Project

**Purpose:** Simple, AI-driven work session management for project tracking and R&D tax compliance.

---

## 🎯 **How It Works**

This system uses **AI-readable protocol documents** that define exactly what should happen when you start or end work sessions. Simply tell your AI assistant to execute the protocols, and it will handle all the documentation updates automatically.

### **Available Protocols**

1. **[Sign-In Protocol](SIGN_IN_PROTOCOL.md)** - Start work sessions
2. **[Sign-Off Protocol](SIGN_OFF_PROTOCOL.md)** - End work sessions

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### To Start a Work Session:
**Say to your AI:** *"Execute sign in protocol"*

**What happens:**
1. AI checks if previous session was properly signed off
2. AI asks about your goals for this session
3. AI reviews current project status and priorities  
4. AI updates session tracking documents
5. AI gives you a helpful session briefing

### To End a Work Session:
**Say to your AI:** *"Execute sign off protocol"*

**What happens:**
1. AI asks what you accomplished this session
2. AI asks how many hours you worked (for R&D tax compliance)
3. AI asks about your next session priorities
4. AI investigates what changed since last session
5. AI updates all relevant documentation
6. AI confirms completion with session summary

---

## 📁 **Files Updated Automatically**

### Every Session
- **`docs/PROGRESS_LOG.md`** - Detailed session logs

- **`docs/management/TASKS.md`** - Task status updates

### As Needed (Based on Work Type)
- **`docs/README.md`** - If navigation changes
- **`README.md`** (root) - If major features added
- **`docs/architecture/`** files - If architectural work
- **`docs/guides/`** files - If process changes
- **Any specific files** mentioned in accomplishments

## 🔧 **Setup Requirements**

### **None!** 
The system is ready to use immediately. Just ensure these files exist:
- `docs/PROGRESS_LOG.md` ✅ (Already exists)
  
- `docs/management/TASKS.md` ✅ (Already exists)

Your AI assistant will read the protocol documents and follow them automatically.

## 📝 **Example Usage**

For detailed examples, please see the protocol files:
- **[Sign-In Protocol](SIGN_IN_PROTOCOL.md)**
- **[Sign-Off Protocol](SIGN_OFF_PROTOCOL.md)**

---

## 🎯 **R&D Tax Compliance**

The system automatically maintains R&D tax compliance by:

- **📊 Tracking Hours:** Precise work time recording
- **📝 Documenting Activities:** Detailed descriptions of R&D work
- **🗂️ Categorizing Work:** Development, research, problem-solving activities
- **📋 Audit Trail:** Complete documentation for tax purposes
- **📈 Monthly Reports:** Ready for accountant/tax advisor

**Estimated Value:** Proper R&D documentation could unlock thousands in tax incentives annually.

---

## 🛠️ **Customization**

Want to modify the protocols? Simply edit the markdown files:
- **[SIGN_IN_PROTOCOL.md](SIGN_IN_PROTOCOL.md)** - Customize session start process
- **[SIGN_OFF_PROTOCOL.md](SIGN_OFF_PROTOCOL.md)** - Customize session end process

The AI will automatically follow any changes you make to these protocol documents.

---

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **Protocol Not Working?**
1. Check that protocol files exist and are readable
2. Ensure your AI assistant has access to the codebase
3. Try rephrasing your request (e.g., "run sign off protocol")

### **Files Not Updating?**
1. Check file permissions in your repository
2. Ensure the AI has write access to the docs folder
3. Manually verify the files exist and are writable

### **Missing Information?**
1. The protocols are designed to work with incomplete information
2. Provide what you can, the AI will use reasonable defaults
3. You can always update documentation manually if needed
