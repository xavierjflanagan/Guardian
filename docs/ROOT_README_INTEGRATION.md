# Root README Integration Strategy

**Issue:** There are now two README files with overlapping but different purposes:
- **`/README.md`** (Root) - Project overview, architecture, code standards, getting started
- **`/docs/README.md`** (Docs) - Documentation navigation hub

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recommended Solution**

### Option 1: Coordinate the Two READMEs (Recommended)

**Root README.md** should focus on:
- Project overview and mission
- Quick start for developers
- Code quality standards
- Architecture overview
- Link to comprehensive docs

**docs/README.md** should focus on:
- Detailed documentation navigation
- Audience-specific paths
- Comprehensive guides and references
- Project management information

### Suggested Root README Updates

```markdown
# Guardian

> **Patient-owned healthcare data platform** - Secure, portable, and accessible medical records management

[Current content about project overview, architecture, code standards...]

## ðŸ“š **Documentation**

For comprehensive documentation, guides, and detailed information:

**â†’ [View Complete Documentation](docs/README.md)**

Quick links:
- [API Documentation](docs/api/endpoints.md)
- [Deployment Guide](docs/guides/deployment.md)
- [Troubleshooting](docs/guides/troubleshooting.md)
- [Project Status](docs/management/TASKS.md)

## Getting Started

### Clear Separation of Concerns

| File | Purpose | Audience | Content Focus |
|------|---------|----------|---------------|
| `/README.md` | Project introduction | New visitors, contributors | Overview, quick start, standards |
| `/docs/README.md` | Documentation hub | Active developers, maintainers | Comprehensive guides, references |

## ðŸ”„ **Implementation Steps**

1. **Update root README.md** to link to docs system
2. **Keep current project information** in root README
3. **Ensure docs/README.md** complements rather than duplicates
4. **Cross-reference appropriately** between the two systems

This approach maintains the valuable content in your root README while leveraging the comprehensive documentation system we just created.
