--------------

1. Version of SNOMED CT - July 2010

2. Version of UMLS - 2010AA

3. The main change in this version is the addition of 60 new SNOMED CT concepts created upon our request. Other changes are results of synchronization with SNOMED CT and quality assurance.

--------------

1. Version of SNOMED CT - Jan 2010

2. Version of UMLS - 2010AA

3. The only change in this version is the synchronization of UMLS_CUIs with the latest UMLS release. Only concepts that are still active in the Subset are updated.

4. Concept counts:

	Total			: 5,738
	Retired	from Subset	:    70
	Active in Subset	: 5,668

201002 Version
--------------

1. Version of SNOMED CT - Jan 2010

2. Version of UMLS - 2009AB

3. 550 new concepts are added. They are from two sources:
	- additional manual review of local terms not previously mapped to SNOMED CT
	- new SNOMED CT concepts added by IHTSDO upon our request to replace CORE concepts that are outside the 4 main hierarchies (Clinical finding, Procedure, Situation with explicit context, and Events) e.g. '444231005 Thymoma (disorder)' added which will replace '128856005 Thymoma, no ICD-O subtype (morphologic abnormality)'

4. 59 concepts are newly retired. The majority of these are due to addition of new concepts as described above. Some are retired because they are no longer current in SNOMED CT.

5. Change in the method of calculating OCCURRENCE and USAGE - previously these are calculated using all terms in the datasets, including those that are outside the 95% usage cutoff. From this version onwards, only terms within the cutoff are used. The new OCCURRENCE data will be different from the previous version, but the USAGE data are very similar. This will have minimal effect in the ranking of the concepts based on USAGE.

6. Concept counts:

	Total			: 5,738
	Retired	from Subset	:    70
	Active in Subset	: 5,668

7. Concept counts by SNOMED CT hierarchy (excluding concepts retired from Subset):

--------------

	Total			: 5,191
