# Today's Plan: Pass 1 Entity Detection Implementation
**Date:** Friday, October 3rd, 2025
**Goal:** Build working Pass 1 prototype and start testing

---

## Morning Session (Current)

### Phase 1: Core Pass 1 Implementation ✅ COMPLETE!
- [x] Review database schema (entity_processing_audit has all fields we need)
- [x] Review existing code (entity_classifier.ts, schema_loader.ts)
- [x] Create `apps/render-worker/src/pass1/` directory structure
- [x] Created Pass1EntityDetector.ts (main class with dual-input support)
- [x] Created pass1-prompts.ts (AI prompt templates with vision + OCR)
- [x] Created pass1-schema-mapping.ts (entity subtype → database schemas)
- [x] Created pass1-translation.ts (AI JSON → database format - PURE CODE, NO AI)
- [x] Created pass1-types.ts (TypeScript interfaces)
- [x] Created index.ts (clean exports)

**Pass 1 Module Complete:** 2,395 lines of code, 7 files

### Phase 2: OpenAI Integration ✅ COMPLETE!
- [x] Added real OpenAI GPT-4o Vision API calls
- [x] Dual-input prompt system (vision + OCR)
- [x] JSON response format with structured entity data

### Phase 3: Worker Integration ✅ COMPLETE!
- [x] Integrated Pass1EntityDetector into worker.ts
- [x] Added 'pass1_entity_detection' job type handling
- [x] Connected to job queue
- [x] Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Successfully built render-worker

**Status:** Pass 1 implementation complete - ready for testing

### Phase 3.5: Complete Pass 1 Database Operations ✅ COMPLETE!
**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Pass 1 must write to 7 tables, not just 1!

Bridge schemas specify Pass 1 must CREATE/UPDATE:
1. ✅ entity_processing_audit (DONE)
2. ✅ ai_processing_sessions (DONE - session coordination)
3. ✅ shell_files (DONE - Pass 1 status updates)
4. ✅ profile_classification_audit (DONE - safety critical)
5. ✅ pass1_entity_metrics (DONE - performance tracking)
6. ✅ ai_confidence_scoring (DONE - quality metrics)
7. ✅ manual_review_queue (DONE - low-confidence flagging)

**Implementation:** All 7 tables handled in `pass1-database-builder.ts` + worker integration
**Clarification:** Bridge schemas are OUTPUT specs (what we write to DB), not INPUT to AI

### Phase 3.6: Documentation & Organization ✅ COMPLETE!
- [x] Updated bridge-schema-architecture README (three-tier system explained)
- [x] Organized Pass 1 planning docs (active vs archived)
- [x] Created Pass 1 implementation README
- [x] Archived outdated planning documents
- [x] Fixed TypeScript build errors

**Status:** All implementation and documentation complete

## Afternoon Session

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create test suite with sample medical documents
- [ ] Run Pass 1 on real document (PDF or image)
- [ ] Verify database records created correctly
- [ ] Check entity_processing_audit table population
- [ ] Validate dual-input processing (AI vision + OCR cross-reference)

### Phase 5: Debugging & Refinement
- [ ] Fix any issues found during testing
- [ ] Adjust confidence thresholds if needed
- [ ] Verify cost estimates are accurate
- [ ] Check processing speed

---

## End of Day Goals

**Must Have (Blocking for Pass 2):**
- ✅ Pass 1 entity detector working with real AI
- ✅ Translation layer correctly flattening AI output to database
- ✅ All 7 database tables integrated
- ⏳ At least 1 successful end-to-end test (document → entities in database) - PENDING

**Nice to Have (Can defer):**
- Error handling for edge cases
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive test coverage

---

## Technical Notes

### Translation Layer (CRITICAL CLARIFICATION)
- **This is PURE CODE** - no AI involved
- Simple JavaScript function that flattens nested JSON
- Maps AI output structure → database column names
- Example: `ai_response.visual_interpretation.ai_sees` → `ai_visual_interpretation` column

### Entity Subtypes to Database Schemas Mapping
```
vital_sign → ['patient_clinical_events', 'patient_observations', 'patient_vitals']
medication → ['patient_clinical_events', 'patient_interventions', 'patient_medications']
diagnosis → ['patient_clinical_events', 'patient_conditions']
etc.
```

### Existing TypeScript Files Fate
- `entity_classifier.ts` - Archive after enhancing into Pass1EntityDetector.ts
- `schema_loader.ts` - KEEP for Pass 2 (loads schemas to send to AI)
- `usage_example.ts` - Archive (demonstration only)

---

## If We Crash & Restart

**Resume from:**
1. Check todos in code: `grep -r "TODO" apps/render-worker/src/pass1/`
2. Last file worked on: `ls -lt apps/render-worker/src/pass1/ | head -5`
3. Current progress: Read this file

**Quick Context:**
- Pass 1 = entity detection (AI vision model analyzes document)
- Creates records in `entity_processing_audit` table
- Prepares entities for Pass 2 (clinical enrichment)
- Uses GPT-4o Vision + OCR cross-validation

---

## Success Criteria for Today

Can we answer YES to these questions?
1. ✅ Does Pass 1 successfully call OpenAI GPT-4o Vision? - CODE COMPLETE
2. ✅ Does it correctly classify entities into 3 categories? - CODE COMPLETE
3. ✅ Does the translation layer write to all 7 database tables? - CODE COMPLETE
4. ⏳ Can we process 1 test medical document end-to-end? - TESTING PENDING

**Current Status:** 3/4 complete - Implementation done, testing pending

---

## Current Status Summary

**Implementation:** ✅ COMPLETE
- 2,395 lines of TypeScript across 7 files
- All 7 database tables integrated
- Worker integration complete
- Build successful

**Documentation:** ✅ COMPLETE
- Bridge schema architecture README updated
- Pass 1 planning docs organized and archived
- Implementation README created

**Testing:** ⏳ PENDING
- End-to-end test with sample document
- Database verification across 7 tables
- Entity classification accuracy validation

**Next Step:** Create test suite and run first end-to-end test
